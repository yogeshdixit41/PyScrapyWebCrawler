{"body": "Although personal accident policies have been around for decades and are much cheaper than term insurance covers sold by life insurers,sales have not picked up because agents do not find it economical to sell these policies.For instance,under New Indias standalone personal accident cover,one can be insured for Rs 4 lakh for as low as Rs 125."},
{"body": "Same is the case with householders cover  a policy that protects both the house and its contents.The innovation that New India plans to offer is a floating sum insured for household items.Thus,the insured would be able to claim for up to a particular value rather than declare and insure each and every item in the house.We will file the combined policy with the regulator shortly, said G Srinivasan,CMD,New India Assurance."},
{"body": "The move to push retail sales comes at a time when growth in corporate insurance is stagnating.Growth in fire insurance has slowed to 7% despite robust growth in motor and health insurance.Retail business has grown faster than corporate.As a result,the share of retail has grown by two to three percentage points to 65%, said Srinivasan.He added that,going by New Indias numbers,the ratio of claims to premium was lower in retail than in corporate business."},

{"body": "The new SUVs will be raised from two all-new platforms that we are developing, Pawan Goenka,president of M&Ms automotive division,told TOI here.The company is spending about Rs 1,000 crore per platform and these will also be used to drive in other products in the future."},

Our test will be that when we launch the product in a competitive Rs 5-6 lakh segment,where the famous brands are there,will Mahindra be able to manage that. "},

{"body": "One of the biggest challenges of the higher education system in India is the inability of the affiliation system to ensure a common minimum standard across the spectrum, Sankaranarayanan said at the 65th foundation day ceremony of the UoP while citing the large number of colleges affiliated to it.There are a few good institutions within the university,surrounded by many ordinary or even poor institutions, he observed."},
{"body": "Sankaranaryanan said,I will ask the UoP to prepare candidates for exams like the National and the State Eligibility Tests (NET/SET) to improve the availability of teachers in our colleges and universities to some extent.Achieving a decent quality across-the-board for institutions offering higher education in the university and the state at large is a major concern.

{"body": "Sankaranarayanan called for a concerted effort towards exploiting the potential of professionals working in different sectors for teaching students.Pune is a hub of automobile industry,IT and a host of other industries.The university should have a regular interface with these industries not just for improving employability of its students but also for research and for updating knowledge of students, he added."},
{"body": "Thought should also be given to inviting experts from industry,government,corporates and other sectors as visiting professors on a regular basis.This will give the students insights into the actual working of various organizations.We also need to think about guiding students from the financially poor and middle class background for skill development programmes, he added."},
{"body": "Sankaranarayanan described the UoP as one of the countrys finest institutions in terms of attracting foreign students,especially from Asia and Africa,but cautioned it against getting complacent.We need to redouble our efforts to attract students from foreign universities.It will do a world of good to enhance the universitys reputation at the international level, he said."},

{"body": "Chandresh Patel,according to Delhi police,is one of the key henchmen/fixers of Dawood.He was in direct contact with bookies in Pakistan and it was through him that the crime syndicate operated by Dawood initiated spot-fixing by Rajasthan players.Curiously,Chandresh Patel,though known to Mumbai police to be a co-conspirator with Vindoo Dara Singh,is shown only as a witness and not an accused in the Mumbai police charge sheet."},
{"body": "With the approval of Dawood  Ramesh Vyas had taken over the Mumbai turf earlier run by one Firoz.Yet Mumbai police negate any connection between Vyas and Dawood.Ramesh Vyas is projected according to the Mumbai police charge sheet to be only a bookie and an exchange (telephone) operator  "},

{"body": "Diversification is an important aspect to be considered while building a portfolio for long-term investing.A mutual fund category known as balanced/hybrid funds provide a readymade solution to the investors need for a well-diversified portfolio.Coupled with tax benefits and minimization of capital erosion during market downturns,this category is an optimum choice for ones portfolio."},
{"body": "A balanced fund invests money in both stocks and bonds.Its objective is to benefit from capital appreciation of stocks and regular income from bonds.These funds keep an allocation between the two asset classes pretty steady,usually about 65-70 % of their assets in stocks and 35-30 % in bonds for equity oriented balanced funds and vice versa for debt oriented balanced funds (also known as Monthly income plans).These hybrid funds are suitable for those investors who do not want the hassle of investing in a basket of products that needs to be rebalanced at regular intervals."},
{"body": "No single asset class consistently stands out as a top quartile performer.Depending on the macro economic factors,every asset goes through ups and downs.Financial markets move through different phases.For example,debt funds had an exceptionally good year in 2008,on the other hand between 2003 and 2007 equity funds had a dream run.Thus to avoid the mistake of chasing the asset class that has given the best near-term returns,one can invest in these balanced funds to benefit from the best of both asset classes."},
{"body": "In line with one's financial goal,individuals need to periodically rebalance their equity and debt investments if held separately.However,this can be a tedious exercise,along with having tax and cost (of rebalancing) implications,and other factors like lack of proper information.These challenges can be avoided by investing in a balanced fund as the responsibility of asset allocation and portfolio rebalancing lies with the fund manager,and investors get the benefit of both equity and debt by investing in one fund."},
{"body": "In terms of taxation,since the balanced funds invest at least 65% in equity,they are treated at par with equity investments and attract no tax liability on capital gains if held for more than a year.On the other hand,balanced funds having equity allocation less than 65% would fall under the debt fund category,where capital gains are taxable.This means that even the equity portion of the fund gets taxed.However,these are eligible for indexation benefits (capital gains adjusted for inflated cost of purchase),attracting a lower taxation,if held for more than a year."},
{"body": "Depending upon your financial goal and risk appetite,you should look at equity allocation of the fund and invest accordingly.Higher equity allocation would be more risky compared to balanced funds having lower equity allocation.To further lower your portfolio concentration risk,recently a number of hybrid funds have started offering exposure to gold and other alternate asset classes in combination with investment in equity and debt."},

{"body": "It was February 14 last year when we met Jay and Purvi (names changed) for the first time.They wanted to gift each other a financial plan on Valentines Day almost a year after their marriage.But they realized that even after a decent income they didnt have much savings.Jay (28) is a software professional and Purvi a doctor.We explained what financial planning was about and told them that the success it lies in its implementation and so here a joint effort was needed."},
{"body": "Jay and Purvi took almost a month to come back to us with their financial details.As we started working on their financial data,the most critical thing which we noticed seems to be the case with a lot of young couples: Their expenses and financial commitments are high.A break-up of their expenses then is given in the table."},
{"body": "Their entertainment expenses,holidays and club membership were taking away about 50% their income and they were not aware of this till they started noting the expenses.We both have had a very humble upbringing but as we got good paying jobs and all possible loans waiting at our doorstep,I guess we went overboard, said Purvi.They would go to the best of the restaurants,swipe their credit cards as and when they liked,bought a high-end car by just looking at the monthly commitment and not the full amount,and the same for their holidays.So we told them that even a small amount saved and invested wisely today could make a substantial impact to their financial goals,it could even help them retire earlier,help them buy a property or help them maintain a similar lifestyle in the future.Their expenses could also be a result of peer pressure.More often than not,many financial decisions happen because of things not related to finance.So it was crucial to hold back emotions for some time and actually understand if this commitment will help build an asset or a liability."},
{"body": "They bought insurance without understanding the features of the insurance plan,but for saving taxes and were told they would get excellent returns on this product and also a life cover.We had to tell them insurance was only for risk mitigation and a term insurance plan was the best product which helps one cover substantial risks,and that too at a very low premium.Opting for an online policy will make it even cheaper."},
{"body": "Its nearly a year,and Jay and Purvi have taken up the financial planning exercise seriously.They act upon the steps agreed,never miss reviews and are always forthcoming with doubts and queries which are all signs of a family wanting to achieve financial freedom.In one year there has been a considerable change in their financial cash flows and liabilities,are leading a comfortable lifestyle with far lesser outflows and building assets for the future."},
{"body": "Here are some important takeaways for newly married couples from this case: "},
{"body": "There is a tendency to over spend in the initial years of marriage.Please understand that the biggest resource of financial planning is time and not money alone.The faster you start planning you could achieve your goals smoothly."},
{"body": "Budgeting is a crucial exercise which will help you in laying down benchmarks for expenses which will check the deviation from time to time and keep finances on track."},
{"body": "Purvi and Jays plan succeeded because they were serious about their planning and got involved in its process.A financial plan not implemented is a futile exercise.So a plan alone cannot achieve success until and unless its backed by your involvement."},
{"body": "Financial planning does not mean only investment planning.Cash flow and debt management are also crucial aspects of planning.According to Warren Buffet,the biggest risk in life is not knowing what one is doing.So just investing without adequate knowledge of the same could lead to your money not working harder for you.So be well informed before investing.Investing only for saving tax cannot always be a goal."},
{"body": "Gifting expensive gifts and splurging money on Valentines Day is not the only way to show someone how much you love them but by gifting each other a financially secure future could be a better gift."},

{"body": "\r\n      "},
{"body": "Inputs from both the spouses give correct picture,help create realistic long-term road map for wealth creation "},
{"body": "Often a financial plan is perceived to be an individual-oriented exercise,although in reality it involves the whole family.In a family,financial planners usually insist that there is active involvement of both the spouses,which can make the financial planning process more meaningful and relevant,and its execution smooth.Such involvement also makes the process of periodic review,which is undertaken mainly to eliminate the chances of the plan going off track from its desired path to the final goals,smooth,they say."},
{"body": "It is a common experience for financial planners that the first data inputs for preparing a financial plan for a family come almost entirely from the husband.Somehow,it is taken for granted that the wife should not involve herself in financial matters in a family.However,after we insist in involving the wife too,the results almost always are pleasantly surprising, said Sanjeev Govila,CEO,Hum Fauji Initiatives."},
{"body": "According to Tarun Birani,founder and CEO,TBNG Capital Advisors,its important to have the involvement of the woman of the house at the planning stage since most of the time she takes care of household expenses on day-to-day basis.He feels it is always advisable to set various days assigned with specific tasks at planning stage itself.The two most important ones are budgeting day and goal setting day.Decide a day at the start of the year and plan monthly,quarterly,half yearly and annual budget together.While budgeting,you can have a look into various categories of expenses like household expense,transportation,liability repayment and discretionary and discuss them in detail, Birani said.If the lady of the house is not involved in budgeting,then there are chances of the budget plan going off track due to some reasons.Her participation will keep her in the loop on expenses and savings, he said."},
{"body": "Accordingly,the goals setting day is used to look into lifestyle,childrens education and upbringing,their marriage,retirement etc and from every aspect these decisions involve the whole family.So,inputs and discussion over it by both the husband and the wife will give a better picture on funds requirement,priority and the expected time frame to meet these goals.Having a goal setting day every month will help keep a tab on set goals and also give an opportunity to discuss upcoming uncertain goals for the family as a whole, Birani said.He feels that women are more focused in life and have long-term vision while setting goals.They have the ability to better prioritize the goals during discussion and goal setting stage.Women also have better understanding on childrens interests and career goals as they spend more time with them and can give better inputs while discussing childrens goals, he said."},
{"body": "At times,its also seen that while the wife has a more realistic approach to setting goals,the husband is far removed from the practicalities.Govila came across an air force officer who had expectations of sending their two children to an expensive boarding school in the next three years,was in the process of acquiring a flat for his family,two office spaces for investment,paying for eight insurance policies with yearly premium of Rs 2.22 lakh and yet was planning to take VRS four years later,all from his salary income.Fortunately,his wife was associated with the financial planning process right from the beginning and was instrumental in moderating the expectations.She had her reservations about many of the goals they were pursuing but she herself was keen to send their children to the boarding school, Govila said."},
{"body": "After goal setting,its time for execution when the expenses and investments are planned together.Engage your spouse to keep a record of expenses in excel sheet or follow envelopebudgeting system to control spending habits every month.Prepare an envelope for each category of expense and keep aside the money for that expense during the month.For investments start an ECS from your bank account, said Birani.He feels women are more disciplined in executing the plan while men often get occupied in regular office routine and delay the execution part."},
{"body": "During plan reviews too,women are usually seen to be more organized and stick to schedules for review meetings with planners.Also investments require long term strategic focus which due to high emotional intelligence its been proven that women fare better, Birani said."},

{"body": "BJP has outlined its plan to mobilise OBCs,who constitute about 35% of voters in UP,on the assumption that the partys opposition to reservation in government jobs and educational institutions on the basis of religion  which would likely cut into OBC quotas since SC/ST quotas are more sacrosanct  will galvanise OBC communities to vote for it.In western UP the August-September communal clashes have led to polarisation,ensuring substantial support of Jats and upper castes for BJP.With BJPs prime ministerial aspirant Narendra Modi playing the caste card  he is himself an OBC  the party appears to have devised a new strategy to enlist the support of OBCs."},
{"body": "What could stand BJP in good stead in UP is anti-incumbency due to poor governance (for which SP will likely be blamed) and rising prices (for which the Congress-led government at the Centre is likely to be blamed).The partys plans to field Modi in UP are aimed at making gains at the cost of SP whose Samajik Nyaya Adhikar Rath Yatra,which began from Lucknow last week,is a renewed struggle to win over OBCs that were its traditional voters in the past in the central Doab region,its stronghold.With its mishandling of the Muzaffarnagar riots SP cannot be assured of Muslim support across the state,leave alone western UP,though in eastern UP the OBC-Muslim social base could still work in its favour."},

{"body": "The plan to develop eight safe street food zones in Delhi is a boon for food lovers and street food vendors alike.Delhi,like many other cities in the country,can boast of a rich street food culture.Representing an eclectic range of delectable dishes,street food exemplifies the rich traditions of Indian cuisine that is affordable and readily available.In fact,Indian street food is one of the many attractions for foreign tourists visiting India.But street food outlets and push carts have been often found wanting in hygiene standards.This is precisely why creating safe street food zones to ensure minimum standards is a good idea."},
{"body": "In this initiative,the National Association of Street Vendors of India (Nasvi) will train vendors in the safe zones to follow basic hygiene practices such as wearing aprons and gloves,and handling food properly.Once the vendors pass the training,their outlets will be eligible to receive a safety stamp from Nasvi.Its in the interest of street vendors themselves to obtain a safety certificate,as this would automatically result in positive advertisement for their outlets and draw in more customers."},
{"body": "Designated street food zones would also help regulate foodborne diseases through focussed inspections.Further,these would enable municipal bodies to provide better services to vendors such as clean drinking water,sanitation etc.There are lessons here to be learnt from Taiwans famous night markets.The latter helped put Taiwanese cuisine on the world map,with thousands of tourists visiting the small East Asian nation just to sample its food culture.Apart from delicious dishes,Taiwans night markets also curb food adulteration and other unscrupulous practices through collective responsibility.Theres no reason why this model cannot be replicated here,with eight safe street food zones soon rising to 80,800,8,000 and so on."},
{"body": "Delhis attempt to carve out safe zones for street food needs to be seen in the context of an ongoing attempt to enforce standards of hygiene and sourcing on food served across all commercial establishments in India.This attempt is misguided.The bone of contention is not that there should be no standards,but a one-size-fits-all approach to regulation is impractical.It is reminiscent of other wellintentioned but ill-conceived regulations such as those concerning labour,which ended up being counterproductive."},
{"body": "Estimates suggest there may be 10 million street food vendors in urban India who cater to millions more.From a functional standpoint,the most important aspect of street food is cost.It meets the needs of consumers on a tight budget as capital costs for street food vendors are low.Any attempt to regulate street food needs to consider trade-offs.Enhanced standards of hygiene in the form of gloves and bottled water would translate into an increase in price of food.This development,in turn,would reduce access to inexpensive food for some consumers.The trade-off here is between enhanced hygiene and access to food.When seen in this context,safe zones and regulatory directives on hygiene to street food vendors rest on a weak foundation."},
{"body": "It is inaccurate to portray street food vendors as impervious to change.Across urban India,some street food vendors have enhanced hygiene standards in response to pressure from customers.In parts of Delhi,it is common to come across street food vendors using gloves even without a regulatory directive.Increasing public awareness and higher incomes will usher in better standards.A premature move here will only make street food vendors vulnerable to harassment at the hands of petty bureaucracy and the food unaffordable for some consumers."},

{"body": "To meditate,it makes a lot of difference sometimes when you can take an image home,for reflection.When we were young,Guru Pandit Amarnath ji once explained to us the nature of raga-meditation : It is just like this.If you sit by a pond,and throw a stone into it,there will be ripples for some time even after the stone hits the bottom of the pond. He was talking about the mystic dive that triggered off cycles of musical expression during the singing of the raga.A meditation by which,travelling inwards,you started from a point of connection,and worked out to a thrilling release into the vast,endless infinity."},
{"body": "In the language of the nada yogis,this stone at the bottom of the pond was the sur ki chot  the awakening of the soul by the swara or note,to stir the music that lay deep inside,in the subconscious that triggers musical expression in an abstract or inward direction,which is what the unfolding of the music of the ragas was all about.Abstract was non-rational expression,from the antar-yatra or inward journey,which took some initiation to comprehend."},
{"body": "In the shastras this has also been described as the nada-bindu kaalateetam  bindu being the point of creation of the universe as a sound universe,born out of visphot or explosion,from the union of Shiva and Shakti.The purpose of this universe of sound,though manifest,samadhi,meditation or transcendence,signified by the word kaalateetam  ateetam meaning to transcend,and kaala meaning the threefold division of time.Nada-bindu kaalateetam is the story of an immense bliss experienced during the dissolution or merger,which is the goal of all meditation."},
{"body": "The point of concentration lies at the pitch note,the Sa,whose depths,according to nada yoga,are fathomless.And yet,Sa is also a rooted swara or note  pitching the note also gives the musician a sense of bearing in all the fathomlessness,and is the point from which the mystic will stir."},
{"body": "But the mystic dive is easier said than done.Singing the Sa alone will not necessarily create the magic.The history of great music speaks of connecting with the mystic as the road to penance,renunciation,painand yet more pain,upon which,at some moment,the mystic will reveal its beatitude,also referred to in nada yoga as karunayi laya,the bliss of divine compassion.Hence Surdas and Mirabai chose to live on the streets of their towns and villages,embracing austerities while longing for the eternal Beloved.In Indic tradition,practitioners of classical music performed penance and austerities for months at places of worship,like the Mookambika  the Saraswati temple at Kollur  to receive the boon of mystic swara,communication from the Divine."},

{"body": "The committee is also of the opinion that the franchise owner of CSK India Cement) is responsible for failing to ensure Meiyappan (a team official ) had complied with the BCCI Anti-Corruption Code,IPL Operational Rules.IPL Regulations and hence the franchise's actions are in violation of Section 4.4.1 of the IPL Operational Rules and Clause 11.3 of the franchisee's agreement,\"the panel said."},

{"body": "It clarified that it was for the concerned criminal courts to determine whether Meiyappan and Vindoo were guilty of the offences alleged against them by various police forces in pending cases.However,it indicted both India Cements and CSK for distancing themselves from Meiyappan's activities when it was clearly established by the evidence that he was a team official.CSK had pleaded that the team should not be penalized for actions of Meiyappan."},
{"body": "\"The franchisee owners (India Cement ) had defended the actions of the franchisee by contending/stating that Gurunath Meiyappan was not related in any way with the franchisee.The stand taken by the franchisee appears to be contradicting the factual position,\"the Committee said."},

{"body": "After two embarrassing failures,the government is sitting pretty,now that the 2G auctions have been a success.The auctions have already netted it in excess of Rs 52,500 crore  much above the target of Rs 40,000 crore."},
{"body": "How did the government suddenly get its mojo back This paper has long argued that e-auctions,with correctly set reserve fees,are the right method for allotting natural resources.More specifically,the reserve fee must be set as low as possible  just high enough to cover the basic cost of the resource,but low enough for it to attract as many bidders as possible.Thats what the government managed this time.As telecom minister Kapil Sibal told this paper,We t o o k t h e b o l d s t e p o f r a t i o n a l i s i n g r e s e r v e p r i c e s. "},
{"body": "To be sure,DoT has lowered reserve fees after each failed round.When it started auctions for 1800 MHz spectrum in November 2012,it kept the reserve fee at an eye-popping Rs 14,000 crore for a 5 MHz pan-India block.As a result,bidding was lacklustre earning the government just Rs 9,704 crore.There were no bids in the four major circles of Delhi,Mumbai,Karnataka and Rajasthan.Worse,there were n o bids received in the 800 MHz spectrum."},
{"body": "For the March 2013 auctions,DoT lowered the reserve fee for the four failed circles by as much as 30%.But still,bidders found the reserve fee to be too high,and there was no bidding.It was a complete disaster.In the 800 MHz band,despite a 50% lowering in reserve fees,there was only one bidder  Sistema Shyam  which picked up eight circles for Rs 3,639 crore.For the highly efficient 900 MHz spectrum  being refarmed for the first time  there were n o bids at all.The government had egg on its face."},
{"body": "In the present round,DoT was forced to reduce the reserve fees further.The 1800 MHz reserve fee was lowered by a further 26% and the 900 MHz one by 50%.Its a result of these reductions that the auctions are seeing traction."},
{"body": "Auctions are not easy to understand,even by the brightest minds.Everyone from Trai chairman Rahul Khullar to finance minister Chidambaram to former FM Yashwant Sinha wanted to keep reserve fees too high.Maybe they were all keen to play safe after CAGs stinging indictment in the 2G scam,even though CAG never argued for a high reserve fee.Whatever the case,the lesson is there for everyone to learn.And the lesson is simple.Keep reserve fees low."},
{"body": "Its not the first time this lesson has been there to learn.In 2010 when 3G airwaves were first auctioned,the reserve fees were modest;Rs 700 crore per MHz,or Rs 3,500 crore for a 5 MHz block.Thats what had got bidders interested.Thats why the bidding continued for 34 days and 183 rounds,ending up at an astounding Rs 16,750 crore."},
{"body": "A mistake people make is to think that the reserve fee is what the winning bidder pays for the resource.Its not.It is merely the s t a r t i n gpoint of the bidding.If demand exists,the final bid will be higher.As a thumb rule,this paper has argued the reserve fee should be so set that the final bid is at least 30% higher.If the bidding ends at the reserve fee,or just marginally higher,it means the reserve fee was too high,and the bidding suboptimal."},
{"body": "A key consideration in setting the reserve fee is that all available resources should be successfully auctioned off.In the November 2012 auction,only 42% in the 1800 MHz band could be,and none at all in the 800 MHz.In March 2013,only a small part of the 800 MHz could be auctioned,and none in the 1800 and 900 MHz bands.Not auctioning everything is a scam,with the exchequer suffering real,not notional,losses."},
{"body": "Not being able to auction everything harms public interest as competitive intensity reduces.This leads to higher consumer prices,poor service quality and in general,a listless industry.Further,selling leftover spectrum in subsequent rounds with lower reserve fees causes problems,because winners in these rounds might have paid lesser than the ones who won in the earlier round.This would be unfair to early-round bidders.Besides all this,the government itself loses precious revenues,and interest,on the unallotted spectrum for as long as it remains unallotted."},
{"body": "One can only hope that the government transfers this learning experience onto the other spheres where it is about to commence auctions  coal mines,FM radio,etc."},

{"body": "In contrast,oil companies have to make significant investment in upgrading the quality of fuel,with some estimates pegging the shift to BS-V at over Rs 75,000 crore.There are some refineries that can make the transition quickly but there are several others that need time.In fact,the ones in the North East may find it tough to meet the aromatic requirements even later, said a source familiar with the discussions in the panel."},
