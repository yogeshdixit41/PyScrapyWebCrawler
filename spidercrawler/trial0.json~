{"body": "The Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Bill was passed in Lok Sabha amidst unprecedented pandemonium that forced the government to block live broadcast of proceedings.After days of unruly protests that saw Congress MPs from Seemandhra suspended from the party,the Bills hurried clearance in the lower House was made possible with the UPA acceding to BJPs demand that Seemandhra be appropriately rewarded with a generous financial package.Congress was able to steamroll the Telangana Bill through with little debate or across-the-House support on an emotive issue that could potentially unleash violence in Seemandhra and stir passions even in Telangana."},
{"body": "However,the Bill could still encounter resistance in Rajya Sabha.Although BJP has backed the creation of Indias 29state,senior leader L K Advani has called the process of doing so a perversion of democracy.YSR Congress leader Jaganmohan Reddy has called for a complete bandh in Andhra.Creation of Telangana has been on the cards for a long time.But there are many who question the timing,just before general elections.Given ferocious resistance to the move,its not beyond the bounds of possibility that the Bill will be stalled in Rajya Sabha."},
{"body": "In order to go beyond partisan sentiments and the bitterly contentious atmosphere created by the passage of the Telangana Bill,Parliament must not overlook other business on which there is a greater measure of consensus.For example,corruption has caused disaffection with politics as usual and people across the country want political parties to do something about it.Rahul Gandhi and Arun Jaitley have both assured their parties support for two key proposed legislations that would strengthen the anti-graft institutional architecture but continue to hang fire in Parliament : Right of Citizens to Time-Bound Delivery of Goods and Services and Redressal of their Grievances Bill,2011,and Whistleblowers Protection Bill,2011.They are inter-linked and their passage before the current Parliament session ends  and they lapse  is imperative."},

{"body": "Poor Rahul.An increasing number of people  not all of them necessarily Congress party supporters or sympathisers  are beginning to echo that sentiment.The once formidable Grand Old Party of Indian politics which has been reduced to a travesty of its former self  riddled as it has been lately with scams and undermined by misgovernance and policy paralysis  seems to be playing its last desperate card by fielding Rahul Gandhi,a political innocent,to lead it to Ballot Box 2014."},
{"body": "Rahul,self-admittedly,is at best a reluctant politician,a politician solely on account of his birth into the Nehru-Gandhi line.He has called himself an outsider to party politics,and has gone on record saying that political power is like poison."},
{"body": "As the interview he gave to Times Now showed,he is untutored in political doublespeak.During the course of the interview it became painfully obvious that no veteran member of his party had coached him on how to deal with awkward questions,and what body language to use to convey confidence and determination.Such dress rehearsals before an important public interface are standard practice in politics."},
{"body": "It almost seems that an untested and untried Rahul is being sent out like a sacrificial lamb on the altar of politics.In a way there is a sense of history repeating itself.After Indira Gandhis assassination,Rajiv Gandhi was enlisted into politics,seemingly against his wishes at the time;he felt he had to do his dynastic duty for the sake of the Family.The once carefree Indian Airlines pilot was soon engulfed in a political vortex that led to the stigma of Bofors and the eventual tragedy at Sriperumbudur."},
{"body": "Rahuls recruitment into politics reveals the ideological bankruptcy of the Congress whose sole reason for existence now seems to be to perpetuate the Family dynasty.Ever since the Shah Bano case during Rajiv Gandhis tenure,and the 1984 anti-Sikh riots,the partys vaunted secular credentials have been called into question.Of late,Arvind Kejriwals upstart AAP has commandeered the aam admi mascot that the Congress had claimed as its own."},
{"body": "Mayawatis BSP has wooed away dalit support,which along with minorities formed a vote base for the party whose symbol is a helping hand for the oppressed.Despite talk of youth power,young urban voters are unlikely to view a subsidy-prodigal Congress as an economic growth generator and a provider of much-needed jobs for a rapidly expanding population."},
{"body": "So where does this leave the Congress,a number of whose senior leaders are reportedly reluctant to contest the coming polls for fear of losing Or rather,what does it leave for the Congress Nothing,it would appear,but dynasty,and the duty to maintain that dynasty,which Rahul seems obliged to fulfil,despite his professed distaste for political power and his apparent lack of skill in the art of acquiring and wielding it."},
{"body": "And if,despite all odds,Rahul can lead his party to victory,or at least to a respectable showing at the polls and not a rout,he will have an even bigger task before him.That of reinventing the Congress and giving it a reason for existence beyond that of dynastic duty."},

{"body": "Arvind Kejriwal has just articulated views on governance and economics that are somewhat surprising,given his high-pitched sevenweek stint as Delhis chief minister.He now seems to believe in government with a light touch,where priorities would be providing public goods such as safety,a good judicial system and corruption-free governance.Entry barriers to new businesses are to be lowered and tax rates kept moderate by closing loopholes.His views on governance and economics now look similar to what Swatantra Party once stood for,especially the distaste for an inspector raj which Kejriwal terms extortionist."},
{"body": "If hes now saying that rather than propping up handpicked business groups policy should be designed to be market-friendly and foster competition overall,that is an idea whose time has come.However,Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in power was confrontational and inclined to favour theatrics over the painstaking task of ground level transformation.For instance,Somnath Bhartis hectoring style of dealing with policemen may have earned brownie points among some people but did nothing to transform the police force.That kind of transformation requires thinking through issues and patient persuasion.Transformational politicians know when to let go;Nelson Mandela is an ideal example."},
{"body": "Perhaps AAPs ride to power on the outsider bandwagon limited Kejriwals options.If Kejriwal is able to shape AAP into a successor to Swatantra in days to come,Indian politics will benefit.One of Swatantras founding principles was to end statism which choked opportunities for small producers and traders.Prevailing policy distortions discourage small enterprises,who create most of Indias jobs.Fighting corruption is not antithetical to confronting statism;the former is,in fact,impossible without the latter.We can only hope the real Kejriwal shows up in future."},

{"body": "At the end of this year,American and international forces begin their withdrawal from Afghanistan.Even if a security agreement is signed with the government in Kabul that allows the Americans to retain a small presence,the overarching security umbrella that has been in place since the Taliban defeat in 2001 would have receded.A period when the greater jihad in Afghanistan (and inside Pakistan ) overtook the lesser jihad in Kashmir and against India would come to a close.Twinned with this is Pakistans own but different Taliban threat  in the form of TTP."},
{"body": "What is the state of play in both these trouble zones In Afghanistan,western governments are confident that the Afghan army,largely officered by Tajiks,will be able to take on the Pashtun-led Taliban forces and keep the symbolically important city of Kabul for the foreseeable future.This confidence is somewhat negated by the admission of these very governments that the Taliban is likely to chip away at territory,especially in southern Afghanistan,and will invite defections,seek to win over supporters from the government side,make economic and developmental projects unviable and destroy signs of progress such as girls schools."},
{"body": "Despite this,western diplomatic sources continue to insist that Kabul,though likely surrounded,will still hold.Is this optimism justified How does one square it with reports that property prices in Kabul are falling There is evidence that the citys (non-Taliban Pashtun) elite is moving money and investments to other places,such as Dubai,where the ongoing property boom is dependent at least to some degree on the flight from Afghanistan."},
{"body": "While the Pakistani army would hope for a Taliban takeover of Kabul or at least removal of a leadership in the city that is not in the control of Rawalpindi,the in-house Taliban question in Pakistan poses quite another dilemma.Here Pakistani generals are theoretically determined to fight TTP and stave off a challenge to the state.TTPs ultimate goal is the capture of Islamabad and formal conversion of Pakistan into an Islamist lebensraum.As such,in the battle against TTP,Indians find themselves in the unusual position of rooting for the Pakistan army."},
{"body": "Yet,here too there are complications.Intelligence sources suggest the Pakistan army is too tired and incapacitated to take on TTP in its strongholds of North Waziristan,even if the Nawaz Sharif government gives permission to do so.A quick,decisive victory for the army is ruled out.The TTP has a growing footprint in Punjab and Sindh,including in the urban centres of Lahore and Karachi.An army onslaught would drive TTP warriors out of Waziristan and into the heartland of Punjab.A civil war in Pakistan,to match a civil war in Afghanistan,would result."},
{"body": "Civilian Pakistani politicians,whether Nawaz Sharif or former cricketer Imran Khan,seem to take a more indulgent view of TTP.They look upon it as representing an insurgency and a disaffection that can be appeased with territorial concessions,with imposition of strict sharia laws in its regions and with offering it a slice of political power.That explains peace talks with TTP.In short,the Pakistan army may not even get permission to wage war on TTP,never mind if it can win the war in the first place."},
{"body": "What happens in case of a deal between the Sharif government and TTP Pakistani political leadership would hope to co-opt the Pakistan Taliban,as it has the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT).It is to be noted that TTP,LeT and the Pakistan army recruit from the same areas in Pakistani Punjab.In the short run,the only common target Islamabad can find for the army,LeT and a potentially or partially co-opted TTP is an external adversary.The pressure on India would be obvious."},
{"body": "There is one other concern.Sections of the Pakistan army and Inter-Services Intelligence have a history of testing a new Indian leader.In 1990,V P Singh encountered reckless threats about a nuclear attack on New Delhi.In 1999,Atal Bihari Vajpayee had an invasion on his hands in Kargil.What awaits the prime minister who takes office in New Delhi in May 2014 "},
{"body": "It is possible all of this is scaremongering and actually the civil wars in Afghanistan and Pakistan will continue for long enough to give India breathing space.Even so,a medium-term nightmare scenario  with the Afghan Taliban closing in on Kabul and Pakistan Taliban getting a slice of state power  cannot be ruled out.For India,it would be the perfect storm."},

{"body": "New Delhi: Bharti Airtel,the countrys largest telecom operator,kicked off fresh consolidation in the sector by acquiring Loop Mobile,Mumbai-based mobile service provider controlled by the Khaitan family,in a deal estimated at around Rs 700 crore."},
{"body": "TOI was the first to report about the deal on January 17."},
{"body": "Post acquisition,Bharti will emerge as the largest operator in Indias financial capital,edging past close rival Vodafone.Loop,which has debt of Rs 400 crore,is one of the oldest operators in Mumbai.It has a subscriber base of around 3 million and will take Bhartis combined subscriber base to around 7 million,compared to Vodafones 6.9 million."},
{"body": "The acquisition puts to rest uncertainty over the fate of Loops subscribers as the company had not bid for fresh spectrum in the just-concluded auctions.The companys licence in the 900 MHz band is due to expire later this year and with no fresh lease,the subscribers would have been left in the lurch."},
{"body": "The proposed transaction will bring together Loop Mobiles 2G/EDGE-enabled network supported by 2,500 plus cell sites,and Airtels 2G and 3G network supported by over 4,000 cell sites across Mumbai.It will also offer subscribers the widest exclusive retail reach with 220 outlets that will enable best-in-class customer service, Bharti Airtel said."},
{"body": "The proposed merger will undergo seamless integration once definitive agreements are signed,and is subject to regulatory and statutory approvals,the company added."},
{"body": "The agreement will ensure continuity of services to Loops subscribers with an option to access Airtels services."},
{"body": "Sources said that under the agreement,Airtel will not acquire the employees of Loop Mobile.Status of Loops employees could not be immediately ascertained."},
{"body": "Bharti Airtel shares fell 3% on the Bombay Stock Exchange even when the benchmark sensex rose nearly 1%."},
{"body": "The Indian telecom market is expected to see a wave of consolidation as top companies such as Bharti Airtel,Vodafone and Idea make new investments in infrastructure and new services like 3G and 4G.Deep pockets would be required to stay competitive in the market and many smaller players will have to merge or sell operations in case they do not make new investments."},
{"body": "The Khaitans-controlled Loop,one of Mumbais oldest telcos,carries 400cr debt "},
{"body": "Along with its own 4m subscribers,Bharti Airtels post Loop-acquisition tally will take it just past Vodafones 6.9m "},
{"body": "Loop did not make any fresh bid for spectrum in the recent telecom auctions "},
{"body": "With its 900MHz licence expiring later this year,the deal is a blessing for Loops subscribers "},

{"body": "Mumbai: The income tax department has asked Aditya Birla Telecom (ABTL) to pay Rs 2,400 crore,including an interest of Rs 643 crore,saying the transfer of assets and liabilities to Idea Cellular are not exempt from tax."},
{"body": "ABTL is a wholly owned subsidiary of Idea Cellular.During 2009-10,all the assets and liabilities of the telecom company were transferred to Idea,without any apparent consideration,the department has said."},
{"body": "ABTL had obtained unified access service licence for providing telecom services in Bihar and Jharkhand."},
{"body": "An ABTL spokesperson did not respond to emails,text messages and calls seeking comment.Tax department officials said the company had appealed against the Rs 2,400-crore demand before the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal.Earlier,ABTL had challenged the assessing officers demand,which was confirmed by the commissioner (appeals)."},
{"body": "The department had issued a show-cause to ABTL asking why the demerger should not be treated as a slump sale and thereby liable to tax.As part of the deal,Idea did not pay any consideration to ABTL,whose remaining assets were revalued.The retained assets,which were revalued at Rs 7,331 crore,were adopted by the department as the consideration for the transfer,and capital gains tax was computed."},
{"body": "Further,ABTLs claim that the demerger was akin to gift was not accepted by tax officials."},
{"body": "They also rejected ABTLs argument that being a demerger,the transaction was exempt from tax.On its part,the department was of the view that there were two investors in compulsory convertible preference shares of ABTL  Idea and P5 Asia Holding Investment (Mauritius)."},
{"body": "An investment of Rs 2,098 crore by P5 Asia Holding Investment (Mauritius) in ABTL,in 2008-09,is also under the scanner as this amount was in turn received from Provident Equity Partners VI International LP,Cayman Islands.The foreign tax and tax research division of CBDT has sought details of the foreign entity and the source of funds from the competent authority of Cayman Islands,officials said."},

{"body": "Human rights advocate Asim Sarode said,Educated women in cities are using the Domestic Violence Act to help create space for them to negotiate in a case involving domestic violence.The law is used more in city areas,hence less incidents are reported from Yavatmal,Dhule,Wardha among others.In these districts,the lawyers seem to be unwilling to use this act as they do not know much about it.Though the increase in incident reports points at the increasing awareness among women about the Act,it cannot be denied that domestic violence cases are on the rise in the state.

"},
{"body": "On how helpful the Act has been,Dani said that some of the aspects of the Act have been very helpful.Allowing interim maintenance is a great relief to the affected person.Another positive point of this Act is that the affected person can be given protection so that she continues to live in a designated portion in the home without interference,physical or otherwise from the husband or in-laws.The Act also mandates counseling for the survivor ,though this needs to be enforced more actively.

{"body": "Human rights advocate Asim Sarode said that many domestic violence cases are directly filed in the court.The magistrate then directs such case copies to the protection officer and asks her to file incident report for that case.However,data on the number of such domestic violence cases is clubbed under the Criminal Miscellaneous Application data in the district court.Hence,there is still no exact number available when it comes to registering the total number of cases in a district, said Sarode."},

{"body": "New Delhi: Thousands of employees of around 70-80 companies run the risk of being denied tax exemption on their provident fund contributions from April as their employers have failed to get the approvals for availing the benefit from the Employees Provident Fund Organiation (EPFO),which regulates these entities."},
{"body": "Apart from employers contributing directly to EPFO,the law allows companies to float their own trust to manage retirement savings of their employees.These trusts need to be registered with EPFO before they seek tax exemptions.The provision was introduced in 2006 when there were as many as 200 trusts which were operating without adequate regulation."},
{"body": "In the Budget,the tax department has been extending the deadline for the past several years but this time it could not do so as the government could not amend the Finance Act as part of the interim budget exercise.As a result,the extended run ends on March 31."},
{"body": "Officials said that the list of companies includes some of the biggest names in the corporate sector,multinationals as well as some government entities.These firms now have the option to complete the formalities over the next 40 days or let their employees be deprived of tax benefits.The law allows annual contribution of up to Rs 1 lakh to provident fund be exempt from tax."},
{"body": "A senior EPFO official said trusts started accepting money several years ago,including deposits,which they cannot do unless they are registered under the PF Act and with EPFO.The idea is to ensure that the investment pattern is followed and they are regulated.But several of them have cited various reasons to get an extension.Basically,they have been dragging their feet, the official said.Tax experts said that they expected the government to provide a further extension to enable the trusts to register with EPFO and also claim benefits from the I-T department.But pending that,it would make sense for employees to check if the PF trust they are contributing to has received the all clear signal from EPFO as well as the tax department.In the absence of clearances it would make sense to put money in other instruments such as public provident fund to avail of the Rs 1 lakh exemption.Although companies have the flexibility to manage the PF contribution of their employees,they have to ensure that the returns offered by them at least match those given by EPFO on funds directly managed by it."},

{"body": "Chennai: You could call it the mid-week crisis.Shrinking disposable incomes are keeping customers away on weekends.So,to counter the impact of lowering profits,QSRs (quick service restaurants) are now offering weekday deals  special offers on specific days of the week."},
{"body": "The sector,which had managed to buck the slowdown for long,saw a fall in same-store sales growth for the second consecutive quarter between October and December.Over the last six months,QSR brands and other dine-in restaurants have been trying out different schemes to bring back footfalls,and are now cranking this up a notch with larger offers on certain days of the week."},
{"body": "While Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) and Pizza Corner have buy-one,get-one-free offers on Wednesdays,Dominos Pizza has monopolized Fridays with a similar Friday FreakOut offer.Pizza Hut has Happy Hours offers,promising discounts on orders made between 4pm and 8pm on weekdays."},
{"body": "Usually,consumer spending is almost 50% higher on weekends compared with weekdays,so we saw the need to bring customers to stores on weekdays as well.A Buy-1,Get-1  offer on Wednesday will drive traffic into stores midweek and this has worked, said Joseph Cherian,CEO,GFA Global,which runs Pizza Corner,Cream & Fudge and Coffee World."},
{"body": "Virag Joshi,president and group CEO of Devyani International,the franchisee partner of KFC and Pizza Hut,said,The idea is to increase the customer base and get business up to the weekend levels. "},
{"body": "Singapore-based gourmet donut brand Mad Over Donuts has a flavour festival where it offers donuts in different flavours every month.We also have unique offers every weekend and this is necessary because customers want to see change every time they walk into the store, Tarak Bhattacharya,COO,of the company,said."},
{"body": "While this seems to be working for now,having valuefor-money propositions over a longer period and constantly changing menus and offers are necessary to ensure customers keep coming back,companies say.We have consistently provided more value to our customers through different promotions and loyalty programmes.We strongly believe in providing everyday value to customers,and prefer to drive loyalty and frequency through the introduction of promotions that happen at regular intervals, said Smita Jatia,MD,McDonalds India (west & south)."},
{"body": "The dine-in restaurants sector too rides on the same boat,and has been trying to lure customers with unique offers and heavy discounts."},
{"body": "Same-store sales growth has not been as much as expected and companies are coming out with a range of things.Monopolizing certain days of the week is one strategy,going for value-for-money deals,combo meals are also things brands do to maintain sales.As of now,such offers have worked for us, said Narendra Malhotra,CEO,Oriental Cuisines,which owns a range of dine-in restaurants such as Benjarong,Wangs Kitchen and China Town."},

{"body": "Chauhan stated that it was,however,found that ward 1 was reserved for SC candidate for the previous cantonment election held in 2008.This ward has the highest number of SC population even today.In 2008,the combined population of SC and ST was not taken into account to decide on reservation.As a result the president has directed us to take a legal opinion on it, he said."},

Inside,outside,there is nothing other than godliness.By abusing our senses,we kill the one who could experience it."},
