{"body": "This is with reference to the editorial Great Gambler (February 17).There is no doubt about Arvind Kejrivals sincerity of purpose and his firm stand on corruption.However,Kejriwal should realise that things cannot be changed overnight.Given the chance to govern Delhi he should have proved his credentials by delivering good governance,acting against corrupt officials,creating job opportunities for youth and providing security to women.However,he forgot about finding solutions to problems and got busy with dharnas,agitations and sting operations.Now Kejriwal is in a hurry to enter national politics and fight general elections.If we want to make our country a major power our politicians should put aside their personal ambitions and work for economic growth and development."},

{"body": "Every family is unique and so are their requirements and needs.However,one factor common to all is the need for asset protection and succession planning.Like Wills,a Trust is also an extremely useful instrument in estate and succession planning.It gives you the liberty to protect your assets and make use of them while you are alive and decide who controls and benefits from them."},
{"body": "A Trust is a relationship whereby both movable and immovable assets are transferred by one party (Settlor) to be held by another party (Trustee) for the benefit of a third party (Beneficiary).Trusts can be revocable or irrevocable."},
{"body": "In a revocable Trust,the assets are bequeathed to the Trust where the Settlor has the liberty to recall his assets at any point of time.It is more commonly used as an alternative to a Will to avoid the hassle of Probate and the possibility of a Will being contested."},
{"body": "In a revocable Trust,the assets of the Trust are deemed to be that of the Settlor,whereas in an irrevocable Trust,assets once bequeathed to the Trust and are considered as the assets of the Trust for the benefit of the beneficiaries and get passed onto the beneficiary.An irrevocable Trust is commonly used for asset protection and ring-fencing of ones assets."},
{"body": "A Trust can hold all types of assets that can be held by an individual,that is from shares,real estate,mutual funds,demat accounts,fixed deposits,bank accounts,bank lockers to even art and antiques.It is also allowed to sell or rent Trust property and pass on the income from the same to the beneficiaries."},
{"body": "A Trust can be for a multiple number of years.It can either be time-framed,that is when my child turns 18 or 25 years,or objective-defined,that is on the birth of my grandchild or death of my grandmother."},
{"body": "I feel a Trust is required by each one of us regardless of age or social standing."},
{"body": "It can be used and benefitted by all,be it parents with young children for the benefit of the childs education,individuals with a family member with special needs who is unable to manage assets on his own,elderly members in need of extra medical care or even someone who cannot be trusted with a lump sum bequest."},
{"body": "Alternatively it could be a joint family,a nuclear family or couples who only have each other for support or someone who wants to control his property because of family dynamics."},
{"body": "By setting up a family Trust,you can bridge all the gaps.The Trust would help protect assets and avoid family feuds,protect from business risks during your lifetime,protect your assets from getting eroded as alimony if you or your children decide to call for a divorce at a later stage."},
{"body": "Through a Trust,you can determine how to handle the management of your assets for your benefit during your lifetime and to fence in the assets for the benefit of your loved ones."},
{"body": "A Trust is certainly not a vehicle to replace you but it definitely is a tool which would protect and fulfill the needs of your loved ones in your absence."},

{"body": "If Bara is back on full throttle,that means Lionel Messi is over his injuries and scoring again at a rate that eclipses the greats.The little Argentine chipped in two goals,exquisite of course,in Barcelonas 6-0 obliteration of Rayo Vallecano on Saturday."},
{"body": "Earlier that evening,City eliminated Chelsea from the FA Cup,scoring only twice in a performance so strong that Chelsea was not allowed a shot on goal in the 90 minutes."},
{"body": "The game has another dimension when Baras stars are in good health.Two weeks ago,when Messi was tenderly feeling his way back after months of rest for his tired and torn hamstrings,a coach whose team took full advantage of Barcelonas wounds last season made a significant observation.When all your players are fit, Jupp Heynckes told a Barcelona board member,you still have more talents than us. "},
{"body": "Heynckes retired after his Bayern Munich side cleaned out the Bundesliga,German Cup and Champions League last season."},
{"body": "That is how sportsmen  with some exceptions  talk when the microphones are switched off.Heynckes left Munich in great shape,and Pep Guardiola,the former coach at Barcelona,has added talents to Bayern since replacing him."},
{"body": "Meanwhile,not only has Messi needed a prolonged timeout,but the captain Carles Puyol,the dynamic inventor Andres Iniesta and the galvanic left back Jordi Alba have been nursed through strains and nagging pains."},
{"body": "It hasnt always been appreciated,but Tata Martino,the coach in his first season,has juggled maintaining results at the top while rotating and resting senior players."},
{"body": "The coach had one purpose.He sought to arrive at the business end of the European season with a team fit enough and fresh enough to take on the best in Europe.There might,as people have suggested,be another motive."},
{"body": "Martino is Argentine.Messi and another Barcelona player,Javier Mascherano,are also Argentine.There is a World Cup coming,and Argentina want to be a force in that,just as Spain and Brazil and Germany intend to be."},
{"body": "Even if it is done subconsciously,players do hold something back through the long season to be ready to take on the World Cup.If anyone is to blame for that,it is FIFA and the clubs for filling out the now year-round calendar with ever more lucrative tournaments."},
{"body": "How thrilling,then,it is to see Messi et al.discard their cautious winter coats and turn on their skills again."},
{"body": "Moreover,in modern soccer not all players get to play 90 minutes every game.Martino did on Saturday what he has done before  he substituted the greatest player in the world to spare his legs and his energy for Tuesday in Manchester."},
{"body": "City await him in better heart.The 2-0 victory over Chelsea was achieved without the midfield presence of Fernandinho and the scoring threat of Sergio Aguero.Both are injured,and both make a big difference to City."},
{"body": "However,David Silva was impishly creative on Saturday,and Pellegrini outfoxed Mourinho with his use of substitutions.The first goal was a delightfully quick and precise low cross shot from Stevan Jovetic,the Montenegrin who has had few opportunities to show his class in Manchester."},

{"body": "Soap manufacturers like Hindustan Unilever,Godrej Consumer Products (GCPL),ITC,Reckitt Benckiser and Wipro Consumer Care would benefit from the duty rationalization.The reduction in customs duty for non-edible oils should have a favourable impact on input cost pressures for the soaps category, said Vivek Gambhir,managing director,GCPL."},

{"body": "R Shankar Raman,CFO at L&T,feels that though a positive,the excise duty reduction for the Rs 3-lakh crore capital goods industry has a limited shelf life till June 2014.Achieving targeted revenue growth in a sluggish economy will be a challenge in 2014-15.Measures to boost the health of the manufacturing sector in general and capital goods in particular would require sustained initiatives over the next several years.Thrust to skill development,infrastructure and likely increase in capex spends of public sector undertakings will also aid recovery of the capital goods industry.

{"body": "Lower-priced mobile handsets are set to get costlier with a uniform import duty regime for the sector being proposed in the Interim Budget on Monday.Mobile handset makers are now likely to raise prices of these low-end phones by as much as 3-5 % in due course."},
{"body": "It was only last year that the government had imposed a concessional duty of 1% on mobile phones in the sub-Rs 2,000 category,while a 6% import duty was levied on the more expensive phones.The sub-Rs 2,000 priced phones form as much as 65% of the mobile handset market in India in terms of volume.In terms of value,they account for a share of up to 50% of the market."},
{"body": "This tinkering will impact prices of low-end /basic mobile phones manufactured here, said Hemant Joshi,partner,Deloitte Haskins & Sells,a consultancy fi rm,pointing out that the announcement will,however,not encourage domestic production of handsets as spelt out in the Budget."},
{"body": "The FMs announcement of a uniform excise duty for mobile handsets of 6% with Central Value Added Tax (CENVAT) credit and 1% without CENVAT credit aimed at boosting domestic manufacturing did not fi nd many takers.Ajjay Agarwal,CMD,Maxx Mobile,a domestic handset player which manufactures its line of phones in China,said,We believe the government needs to increase import duty on handsets to about 30% to make domestic manufacturing of handsets more attractive.This Budget announcement apparently will have negligible impact on domestic manufacturing. "},
{"body": "P Balaji,MD,Nokia India,said that the benefi cial Counter Veiling Duty of 1% as proposed in the Budget speech,does not extend to mobile phone manufacturing operations set up within SEZs.This will therefore exclude larger manufacturers like us,which account for a major part of the domestic production,from availing the benefit.We urge the government to extend the incentive to units operating from SEZs and EOUs as well, Balaji said.Additionally,the decision to have a uniform 7% import duty on mobile phones across price bands means that the net duty load on devices in the sub-Rs 2,000 category will increase from 2% to 7%,which will add to costs of entry phones and is likely add to burden on consumers of low end phones,he said."},

{"body": "Fi n a n c e m i n i s t e r P Chidambaram has been applauded by many for showing fiscal rectitude in an election year,but a closer look at the budget numbers suggests that both in the current year,2013-14,and in the coming year,the numbers look better than the reality."},
{"body": "In the current year,the finance ministers budget speech pointed out,the fi scal deficit is likely to be 4.6% of GDP,even lower than the budget estimate of 4.8%.But this has been achieved not by cutting non-productive spending and boosting earnings.On the contrary,the target has been bettered despite nonplan expenditure  most of which is things like interest payments,subsidies,salaries and pensions  being higher than budgeted and tax revenues being lower than expected."},
{"body": "How was this achieved First,by keeping plan expenditure  which you could see as investing in the future  about Rs 8,000 crore below the budgeted amount and raising non-tax revenues to roughly Rs 21,000 crore more than what the budget for the year had projected.Most of this extra non-tax revenue is by way of dividends and profits from the public sector  in short,transferring money from one pocket of the state to another."},
{"body": "As for 2014-15,some of the expenditure fi gures seem extremely optimistic and the receipts fi gures include a huge jump in infl ows from disinvestment in PSUs.For instance,the subsidy bill on petroleum products is projected to come down from Rs 85,480 crore in the revised estimates for the current year to Rs 63,427 crore next year."},
{"body": "Similarly,the fertiliser subsidy bill is assumed to remain static at around Rs 68,000 crore despite the fact that the new gas pricing formula,which roughly doubles the price of natural gas,is bound to add significantly to input costs for the sector."},
{"body": "Disinvestment proceeds are slated to rise from just over Rs 19,000 crore in the RE for the current year to almost Rs 52,000 crore next year.Even assuming this happens,does raising money through selling the family silver really qualify as displaying fi scal rectitude After all,it does not fundamentally change the reality of the government living beyond its means."},

{"body": "In a last-ditch gambit to woo the defence community of 14 lakh serving and over 25 lakh retired military personnel,the government has yanked the long-demanded,much-promised but never-implemented one-rank,one-pension (OROP) rabbit out of its hat in the run-up to general elections."},
{"body": "Finance minister P Chidambaram said the OROP decision will be implemented prospectively for armed forces from 2014-15,with the government transferring Rs 500 crore to the defence pension account in the current fiscal to close the gap for all retirees (pre-2006 and post-2006 ) in all ranks."},
{"body": "This comes just after Congress vicepresident Rahul Gandhi told a group of exservicemen last week that he fully backed their OROP demand,in what now seems to be a scripted interaction.The defence community,after all,swells into a sizeable and vocal vote bank of close to 20 million people if family members are also taken into account."},
{"body": "OROP basically implies payment of uniform pension to personnel retiring in the same rank with the same length of service irrespective of their date of retirement.Consequently,any further hike in pension rates is automatically passed on to past pensioners."},
{"body": "Irate ex-servicemen have been returning their medals and holding rallies over the past five years,which included one with BJP prime ministerial nominee Narendra Modi and former Army chief General V K Singh at Rewari last September,to protest against the non-implementation of OROP."},
{"body": "On Monday,there was again scepticism about whether it was full OROP or just the eyewash of modified parity yet again.The UPA was in power for the past 10 years but this comes only now.Moreover,Rs 500 crore seems paltry.Earlier,the MoD and the controller general of defence accounts had calculated Rs 1,730 crore for 2014-15.Another offi cial figure was Rs 3,000 crore per year for OROP, said a senior military offi cer."},
{"body": "But MoD contended that the contours of OROP and its implementation will be worked out in the coming weeks.The Rs 500 crore is just a provisional figure to show the governments intent, said an offi cial.Chidambaram,too,said MoD had asked for Rs 500 crore but if more was required,it would be fully provided."},
{"body": "The government,however,was mum on the legal and administrative reasons used in the past to junk the OROP proposal.Civilian pensioners,for instance,would demand the same with a heavy financial implication of Rs 8,000-9,000 crore per annum,it had held."},
{"body": "There will be no spurt in military modernization.It will continue to meander in its usual slow manner,with the defence outlay being marginally hiked to Rs 224,000 crore in the 2014-15 interim budget.The 10% hike over the previous outlay of Rs 203,672 crore basically just caters for inflation.In dollar terms,there has actually been a dip from $37.86 billion to $36.13 billion due to depreciation of the rupee."},
{"body": "The worry among military experts is that Indias budgeted defence expenditure is merely 1.74% of the projected GDP for 2014-15,much less than the 3% being demanded for years to ensure modernization and requisite deterrence against both China and Pakistan.In fact,its even less than the 1.79% and 1.9% figures,respectively,of the last two fiscals."},
{"body": "Moreover,revenue expenditure (day-to-day costs and salaries) has gone up to Rs 134,412 crore,surpassing by far capital expenditure for new weapons,sensors and platforms at Rs 89,588 crore.A major chunk of the capital outlay will go to committed liabilities,not leaving much for new projects despite the armed forces being desperate for submarines and howitzers,air defence weapons and helicopters."},
{"body": "The major project is the $20 billion medium multi-role combat aircraft deal for 126 fighters,with final commercial negotiations under way for French Rafale jets.This alone will see an outgo of over Rs 10,000 crore as the first instalment after the contract is inked.Some other important deals close to finalization include the acquisition of 22 Apache attack helicopters (around $1.4 billion),15 Chinook heavy-lift helicopters (around $1 billion),and 145 M-777 ultra-light howitzers ($885 million),all from the US."},

{"body": "The economy has picked up in the second quarter to 4.8% from 4.4%.But this growth hasnt been even across sectors.The more cars you buy there may be no revenue loss.Therell be notional revenue loss if sales remain same and rates are cut.If sales improve what youve lost in rates,you pick up in sales.In the next 40 days well probably lose Rs 300 crore or Rs 400 crore but it could pick up thereafter.In April and May perhaps well lose about Rs 700 crore to Rs 800 crore."},
{"body": "India cant afford to import gold for $50 billion or $60 billion.People must understand every ounce of gold imported is paid for in foreign exchange.Gold import curbs were absolutely necessary."},
{"body": "Ive gone by defence ministry data.It estimated that in 2014-15,apart from the usual money provided for salary and pensions,we may require another Rs 500 crore.If one rank one pension requires in 2014-15 little more than Rs 500 crore,itll be provided.Money will be provided so that the scheme is implemented."},
{"body": "You cant compare excise duty reduction with stimulus packages.The stimulus was to ensure turbulence in the world economy doesnt affect India and our growth is anchored around 7%-8 %.That was a large stimulus package,what the US calls unconventional monetary policy.We borrowed money and spent.Today,we are saying these are specific industry sectors experiencing difficulty.Pay us little less,hopefully you can sell more."},
{"body": "The direction and pace a country must go are determined by an elected government.The RBI Act talks of monetary stability which is impacted by price stability and growth.We should be able to strike a balance between price stability and growth.Even the RBI governor emphasizes that while price stability is a foremost objective,RBI cant be oblivious to needs of growth.There is no contradiction."},
{"body": "My intention was to speak plainly to people and tell them these are turbulent years.Weve done a lot in the last 21 months to stabilise the economy and believe weve achieved a fair measure of success.This budget sends out a signal of hope to people that things will be better.TNN "},

{"body": "PChidambarams interim budget reflects the Congress hope that itd be able to cut its losses as well as a recognition that its last trench manoeuvres might not prove enough."},
{"body": "Some of its features can be likened to targeted strikes by an army locked in a rearguard action.It focuses on constituencies  middle class,consumers,students and former defence personnel  which appear to be rooting for Narendra Modi,and seeks to blunt the perception of UPAs reign being a wasted decade."},
{"body": "The puzzling move to transfer to states thousands of crores thatll be needed for schemes on education,health,rural development and social justice seems to reflect the recognition that itll lose the reins.No government,certainly not one headed by Congress,can be expected to be so generous towards states if its sure of holding on to power.Congress has zealously claimed parenthood of Centre-funded projects;even accusing states of stealing the political copyright of schemes for which funds have now been transferred to states."},
{"body": "The intriguing last-over generosity towards states could be an overture to regional parties which will have a say in deciding who takes Delhi.Cynics would perhaps see it as a ploy to deny Modi elbow room if he makes it."},
{"body": "The desire to salvage Congress prospects is evident in the excise duty cuts on consumer goods and durables.Congress would hope the relief appeases sullenness of the middle- and neo-middle classes who,the party estimates,have been moving towards BJP.Apart from whatever relief they bring to inflation-hit consumers,the FM conceded food inflation remained a worry  the cuts may amplify the message about the economy being under control.The outreach towards students approximately 9 lakh are expected to benefit from the education loan moratorium  can be beneficial.They constitute a fraction of the 149.5 million in the 18-25 age bracket,wholl vote for the first time in an LS poll.But to the extent that they share the anxiety of repaying loans,they constitute a bloc.Congress expectation is that theyll be a political breakwater against the Modi momentum among new voters."},
{"body": "The same calculation is evident in the one-rank,one-pension decision: a longstanding demand of former defence personnel,perceived to be sympathetic to BJP,because of its toughness on national security issues.There was scepticism over whether Rs 500 crore would be sufficient for implementation.The swiftness with which Chidambaram moved on the issue after Rahul Gandhi took it up contrasts with the vacillation which became UPA 2s hallmark."},
{"body": "Chidambarams effort was to refute the perception that UPA had run the economy aground.He cited his success in getting a handle over deficits,poverty,agricultural production and denied a policy paralysis.He expressed confidence people would give UPA another chance because neither populism (read Arvind Kejriwal) nor majoritarianism nor individualism (read Modi) can be the alternative.The sparse treasury benches and the feeble thumping of desks suggested he may not have inspired confidence about a fading regime in its twilight zone."},
{"body": "NO FOOD FOR THOUGHT "},
{"body": "The government has provided for an under-Rs 1,000 crore subsidy bill: increasing allocations to meet commitments under the Food Security Act but providing less for oil and fertilizer subsidies in a bid to show healthier finances."},
{"body": "Allocation for food doles has been upped by Rs 23,000 crore to Rs 1.15 lakh crore but an additional Rs 35,000 crore that government will have to transfer to oil companies for cooking gas,kerosene and diesel subsidies has not been provided for in the current financial year.In fact,P Chidambarams calculations show that fuel subsidy will decline from Rs 85,500 crore in the current fiscal to around Rs 63,500 next year."},
{"body": "That means once the Rs 35,000 crore for current years dues are deducted,the government will be left with Rs 28,000 crore for fuel subsidy next fiscal.Similarly for fertilizers,he has assumed subsidies will remain at Rs 67,970 crore even amid industry complaints that dues remain unpaid."},
{"body": "What Chidambaram has not budgeted for is the rise in the fuel bill for urea manufacturers after gas prices double to $8.4 a unit from April.The minister did not respond to a query on the issue.The inadequate budgeting for subsidies has raised fears that government will miss the spending target for 2014-15.It will likely be a challenge to meet expenditure targets,in particular the assumed decline in fuel subsidies if international prices move up and the exchange rate depreciates during the year, said Leif Lybecker Eskesen,HSBC chief economist for Asia and Asean."},

{"body": "Pune: The Pune district consumer disputes redressal forum has sentenced a city-based tour operator,Mohan Medhekar,to three months simple imprisonment along with a fine of Rs 10,000 for failing to pay a compensation of Rs 1.17 lakh to a Thane-based tourist."},
{"body": "Forum president V P Utpat and member Geeta Ghatge on Friday directed Medhekar to pay the compensation to one Ketan Anant Tare of Mira Road in Thane within six weeks.The forum has issued a nonbailable warrant against Medhekar as his whereabouts are not known after the order was passed."},
{"body": "The case dates back to April 2011,when Medhekar had taken Rs 1.54 lakh from Tare for organizing a tour of Jammu and Kashmir,Vaishnodevi temple and Amritsar for his family.Tare along with his family members reached Srinagar and checked in a hotel.As per the schedule,the family was supposed to visit the temple on April 20,but Medhekar went missing because of which they had to cancel the visit to the temple.For the next few days,the Tare family stayed in Jammu and Srinagar and ended up spending a huge sum on the trip.The family had to travel by air to Mumbai as they did not get train reservation."},
{"body": "Medhekar later reached an agreement with Tare and agreed to pay back Rs 1.61 lakh for the poor service.Of the promised amount,Medhekar deposited Rs 50,000 in Tares bank account and issued a cheque for Rs 1.39 lakh,but the cheque was dishonoured."},
{"body": "On a complaint filed by Tare,the forum passed an ex parte order directing Medhekar to pay 9% interest on the sum of 1.39 lakh to Tare with effect from June 1,2011 and also ordered him to pay a sum of Rs 1,000.After Medhekar did not comply with the forums order,Tare through his power of attorney holder Bandopant Hallur filed a plea on June 26,2012 to initiate further action against Medhekar and send him to prison under section 27 of the Consumer Protection Act."},
{"body": "Medhekar later appeared before the forum with his lawyer S A Karandikar and filed a proposal to return the money in three instalments and relied on a ruling of the Maharahsta State Commission in the case of Surendra D Hatkar v/s John Robert,stating that he should be set free if he is ready to pay the compensation.Medhekar pleaded for leniency considering his age.He was 65 years old then."},
{"body": "Tares lawyer Sanjay Gaikwad argued to take action against Medhekar as he had failed to repay the money despite repeated assurances.He pleaded to reject the proposal of repaying money in instalments."},
{"body": "After hearing both the sides,the forum on February 14 observed that Medhekar did not deserve leniency as he had deceived senior citizens by abandoning them in Jammu and Kashmir.The forum sentenced him to three months simple imprisonment.When contacted,Karandikar refused to react on the forums order.Medhekar was also not available for comment."},

{"body": "The provision for another PSK in the city has been a longpending demand.The issue was brought up by Singh at his meeting with Muktesh K Pardeshi,MEA joint secretary and chief passport officer,who led a three-member team of the MEA on its three-day visit to the city last week to assess the problems affecting the RPO,Pune."},
{"body": "At present,Pune has only one PSK in Mundhwa that caters to more than 1,000 passport applicants on a daily basis,including those coming from Ahmednagar,Kolhapur,Sangli,Satara and Solapur (city and rural).Due to the heavy load,those applying in the normal category have to wait for 35 days on an average for a scheduled appointment."},
{"body": "According to Singh,a second PSK will help distribute the load,which in turn would improve the quality of services offered.One more PSK or at least a smaller office is definitely needed in Pune.We would be able to cater to far more number of people under the normal category which in turn would help reduce the extraordinarily large number of Tatkal applications, Singh said."},
{"body": "His suggestion got a thumbs up also from Vijay Kumbhar,co-convener of Pune Passport Grievances Forum that held an agitation in 2013 for improving the facilities and services offered by the PSK in Mundhwa.We definitely need not one,but two more PSKs in the city.The total area of Pune has increased in the last couple of years and commuting to the PSK,which is located in one corner of the city,is a harrowing experience.It would be best to have a similar facility in the west-end of the city to cater to areas like Katraj,Bavdhan and Hinjewadi, he said."},
{"body": "According to Kumbhar,the heavy load of Tatkal applications are the result of poor services in the normal category.Aspirants have no option but to apply under the Tatkal category as there is no guarantee of time-bound delivery by the routine procedure.Pune is home to the IT and auto-hubs in which there can be sudden demands for international travel,so the high numbers are not surprising, he said,questioning the objection of the RPO considering fees for Tatkal is almost double that of normal."},

{"body": "We are confident as we have made several innovations to improve last years design, said Prem Mishra,a final-year mechanical engineering student who is the captain of the team."},
{"body": "This year,the MK-8  has replaced a conventional stickshift gear box with a Continuous Variable Transmission (CVT),which Mishra hopes will allow the car to accelerate much faster."},
{"body": "Think of it as the difference between riding a motorcycle and a non-geared bike.You dont have to shift the gears,the vehicle changes gears automatically.This way,we cut down on the time taken by the driver to shift between gears, said team member Abhijeet Nassery."},
{"body": "Mishra believes the difference can be crucial,particularly as every fraction of a second counts."},
{"body": "Last year,we were the winners of the acceleration test  which tests how long the vehicle takes to cover a 150-ft distance from zero speed to full throttle.We had clocked 6.65 seconds while the team that came second did it in 6.67 seconds, he said."},
{"body": "With the CVT,the car does it much faster,but the team is tight-lipped about the specifics.Moreover,the results of the acceleration test decide the pole position in the endurance race  a four-hour race that tests the car through rough terrain,Mishra said."},
{"body": "Another advantage over last years design is that the vehicle is about 20% lighter and weighs only 200 kg.This will allow the car to accelerate much more,he added."},
{"body": "We have managed to drop the weight by building customised parts instead of using standard ones.Instead of steel,we have built parts from spacegrade aluminium,which is much lighter, said Mishra.About 70% of the car has been custom-built,he added."},

{"body": "The NDM-1 was first identified in New Delhi and coded by the resistant gene blaNDM-1.Until recently,strains that carry blaNDM-1 were only found in clinical settings or hospitals but in 2008,blaNDM-1 positive strains were found in surface waters in Delhi.Since then,blaNDM-1 has been found elsewhere in the world,including new variants."},
{"body": "By comparing water quality of the upper Ganges in February and again in June,the team showed that levels of blaNDM-1 were 20 times higher per capita during the pilgrimage season than at other times."},
{"body": "The bugs and their genes are carried in peoples guts, said professor David Graham,an environmental engineer based at Newcastle University who has spent more than 10 years studying the environmental transmission of antibiotic resistance around the world.If untreated wastes get into the water supply,resistance potential in the wastes can pass to the next person and spiraling increases in resistance can occur. "},
{"body": "This isnt a local problem  its a global one.We studied pilgrimage areas because we suspected such locations would provide new information about resistance transmission via the environment, Graham said."},

{"body": "Like equity funds,investors must look at factors beyond performance while selecting debt funds.There are a few unique aspects that investors must check out before short-listing debt funds for making an investment."},
{"body": "Since debt funds are largely categorized on the basis of time periods,investors should select the fund which matches their investment horizon.For instance,for an investment horizon of less than a year,investors can select an ultra-short term or a liquid fund,depending on its aptness in their portfolios.Likewise,for an investment horizon of between one and three years,short-term funds would be more appropriate.However,the investor should bear in mind that higher the maturity of debt funds,more prone they will be to interest rate risks."},
{"body": "This is one of the most neglected but a critical aspect of debt funds.For a long time,debt funds have been perceived to carry very low or no risk.Nothing could be further from the truth.Debt funds carry certain inherent risks such as interest rate,credit and liquidity risks.Before investing in debt funds,investors must bear in mind that these risks can have an adverse impact on a funds return."},
{"body": "This is one of the most prominent risks to which debt funds are exposed to.It refers to a change in the price of a bond due to a change in the prevailing interest rate.Higher the duration of the bond,more its price will tend to fluctuate with the change in the interest rate.Hence,in a rising interest rate scenario,investors must consider selecting funds with lower maturity and visa-versa."},
{"body": "The quality of the portfolio or its credit worthiness is another important parameter for selecting debt funds.Each debt instrument in a fund is assigned a credit rating.Higher the credit rating of the funds underlying instruments,less exposed the fund would be to credit defaults.Credit risk is applicable to corporate bond funds and not to government bond funds since the latter have a government backing."},
{"body": "Liquidity is the ease with which a fund manager can sell a particular security in the market.A fund faces liquidity risk if the fund manager is not able to do so due to lack of demand for the security.Liquidity risk is high in funds having a low credit quality portfolio."},
{"body": "Given that returns from debt funds are typically lower,high expenses could make a huge dent on the returns.Therefore,before selecting a debt fund,investors must ensure that the fund has a pragmatic expense structure.Further,various debt funds levy an exit load if investments are redeemed before a specified period.The idea is to deter short-term flows into the fund in order to enable better management of the investments.Hence,an investor should look into exit loads carefully before investing because,just in case of an early withdrawal,these costs could severely impact returns."},
{"body": "The fund size is an important aspect to look at in debt funds because they typically see huge amounts of assets moving in and out of them on a daily basis.A sufficiently funded debt fund would enable the manager to meet re d e m p t i o n p re s s u re s without resorting to stresssell and keep the investor interest intact.This would also help the fund to stay afloat during adverse market conditions when redemption pressure is high."},
{"body": "Besides these,investors should also look at the funds performance (both returns as well as risk-adjusted returns) over a long period.This will help them understand how effectively the manager has been able to manoeuvre the fund through market cycles."},
{"body": "Stocks of good companies are always a buy."},
{"body": "This is not entirely true.Often it has been seen that a very good company has failed to deliver on profits and growth,and hence its share price has not appreciated as much as its competitors.Although the stocks of good companies usually enjoy some premium over their peers,this premium alone may not be enough to outperform them.So,while the stock of a good company may be a good one to look at and analyze,investors at the time of investing should also look for,among other factors,future growth potential of the companies."},
{"body": "Non-performing assets (NPAs) are those loans that have turned bad,meaning the borrowers of those loans are either willingly or for some other reason neither paying interest nor paying back the principal amount.Higher the NPA level (mostly expressed as a percentage of total loans),worse off is the lender.NPAs usually show a rising trend in bad economic conditions.Globally,higher NPAs (also called non-performing loans and bad loans) have often been one of the major factors for the bankruptcy of a financial institution or the closure of a bank."},

{"body": "According to Ramalingam,bank FDs are ideal for investors with a low risk appetite.They are best suited for periods of up to one year or less.While investing in FDs,you should remember that premature withdrawals can attract a penalty,so the investment horizon needs to be finalized beforehand.When markets experience volatility,FDs are the best place to park funds.Though the returns post tax could only be around 7%,FDs would safeguard against erosion of capital, he said."},
{"body": "You can set aside a percentage of your corpus for investments in FDs,and that percentage will depend on the market conditions,your propensity to take risks and the overall investment plan."},

{"body": "Mumbai: The Ruias of Essar shocked UK investors on Valentines Day as they offered to buy the outstanding shares of the London-listed Essar Energy at 70 pence a share,or a sixth of its listing price four years ago.Standard Life Investments,one of the largest institutional investors,called it cynical opportunism."},
{"body": "Essar Energy had raised 1.2 billion pounds by listing shares at 420 pence a piece in 2010.This valued Essar Energy at 5.4 billion pounds.Essar,controlled by the billionaire brothers Shashi and Ravi Ruia,owns a 78% stake in the energy arm."},
{"body": "The offer at a modest premium to the companys closing price of 60 pence on Thursday comes as a surprise to the retail investors and minority shareholders who slammed it as a complete U-turn from the companys earlier plans of selling down more shares to meet UK listing requirements,which mandate that at least 25% of a companys stock be available for trading."},
{"body": "Essar Capital Limited,the dedicated investment manager for Essar Global Fund Limited,confirms an approach to Essar Energy Plc regarding possible offers for the minority shares in Essar Energy it does not already own and for the 4.25% convertible bonds due 2016 guaranteed by Essar Energy, said a statement by Essar Global Fund Limited on Monday."},
{"body": "David Cumming,head of equities at Standard Life Investments,which owns 2.7% in Essar Energy said the announcement on Friday by Essar Global Fund,the investment vehicle of one of Indias richest families,was a calculated attempt to deprive minority shareholders of the substantial future upside in Essar Energys valuation."},
{"body": "Essar Group has been a notable destroyer of investors wealth in India.Now,they are replicating the same model in UK,destroying wealth of global investors, investor adviser S P Tulsian told TOI.The investors would lose about 300 million pounds as Essar promoters offered to pay 912 million pounds for the shares valued 1.2 billion pounds at the time of listing."},
{"body": "Despite doubling its refining capacity and tripling its power capacity since listing,Essars shareholding and economic interests in Essar Energy has eroded by $6 billion due to adverse sentiment with regard to Indias investment climate,including with regard to tax,regulatory and legislative developments and uncertainties.Essar Energys shares rose 52% from the 420 pence a share issue price to a high of 638 pence a share in December 2010.And started falling since then and was trading at 69 pence a share on the LSE on Monday afternoon."},

{"body": "Mumbai: The Interim Budget has set the stage for lower interest rates in coming months,with a lower fiscal deficit target and smaller-than-expected government borrowing programme for FY15.Bond yields fell nearly 10 basis points after the announcement but closed flat."},
{"body": "Interest rate going up is behind us and I dont see any logic for interest rates to go up in future.The good news around the corner is that food prices,which were the cause of high inflation numbers,is coming down.If food inflation eases,RBI has a better rationale to hold or bring down interest rates, said Deepak Parekh,chairman,HDFC.He added that downward revisions would be in small measures and there was no scope for large reductions."},
{"body": "Among bankers there has been some uncertainty over which way rates would move given that RBI has indicated that it is keen to make inflation-targeting its major objective and that it is likely to target consumer prices in future.Falling inflation should bring down interest rates,but with RBI targeting consumer prices it is difficult to say as food prices tend to go up during summer, Arundhati Bhattacharya,chairman,State Bank of India,had said on Friday."},
{"body": "In his speech,the finance minister,however,goaded RBI not to focus exclusively on inflation and to strike a balance between growth and controlling prices.What has cheered the bond markets is the modest government borrowing programme announced by the finance minister.Sonal Varma,an economist with Nomura,said,In FY15,the government has set a fiscal deficit target of 4.1% of GDP,which is marginally better than the expected 4.2%."},
{"body": "Net market borrowing of Rs 4.57 lakh crore is expected to finance 87% of the fiscal deficit,while gross market borrowings are likely at Rs 5.97 lakh crore in FY15,better than market expectations which were in the range of Rs 6.1-6.4 lakh crore. "},
{"body": "The positive sentiment in respect of interest rates also stems from expectation that the exchange rate will be steady.With a fiscal deficit target of 4.1% for FY15 and 4.6% for FY14,economy is well poised to receive confidence of foreign and domestic investors,thus providing much needed support to the Indian rupee, said Nirakar Pradhan,CIO,Future Generali Life Insurance.He added that lower net government borrowing of Rs 4.57 lakh crore is a positive for the bond market and leaves room for corporate borrowings.But most economists also expressed scepticism over the fiscal deficit numbers."},
{"body": "The Interim Budget rightly targets further fiscal consolidation.However,it was clearly an election budget.The pre-election sweeteners,especially the excise duty cuts,will make it difficult to achieve the deficit target.The subsidy target could also prove a challenge.However,the full Budget to be presented after the elections will be the real test of the existing or the new governments willingness and ability to deliver fiscal consolidation, said Leif Lybecker Eskesen,chief economist for India and Asean,HSBC."},

{"body": "The disputed domain name,rpglife.com,redirected internet users to a role playing game (RPG) website.RPGs are an extremely popular genre of gaming where the players assume the roles of characters in fictional settings.Classics such as Dungeons & Dragons (D&D),Final Fantasy and World of Warcraft (WOW) are variants of RPGs.RPG Life Sciences filed the complaint with the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO ),an international arbitration service provider for settlement of domain name disputes.Typically,if the arbitrator finds that the disputed domain name was registered and used in bad faith,it can be transferred to the complainant."},
{"body": "Adomain name is said to be registered in bad faith if it is not used for any legitimate purpose but for cyber-squatting  when domain names of reputed companies are acquired only to sell them at a profit."},
{"body": "However,in this case,not only was the companys complaint denied but the arbitrator alluded that the complaint was filed in bad faith.According to WIPO,the complaint was an attempt to deprive a registered holder the ownership of a domain name,also referred to as reverse hijacking."},
{"body": "Responding to TOIs queries,an RPG Life Sciences spokesperson explained,We filed a complaint as the disputed domain name was deceptively similar to the RPG Life brand.However,WIPO did not allow this complaint. It is important to note that after the order,the opposite party has offered to sell us this domain name.We are contemplating buying it only if it comes at a reasonable price that is justified, added the spokesperson."},
{"body": "Legal experts point out that WIPOs order rejecting the complaint brings out many important facets relating to legitimate use of a domain name.The companys registered trademarks RPG and RPG Life were both distinctive and predated the registration of the disputed domain name,which was registered only on October 28,2005.However,James Mathe,a US resident and the owner of the disputed domain name,was able to substantiate its legitimate use.As WIPOs arbitrator pointed out,Mathe was simply using an established acronym for the words role playing game in conjunction with the word life."},

{"body": "He had a malignant tumour called the WILMS tumour which was detected in its second stage.There is a medical protocol for this as he needs to be there for 15 weeks for taking chemotherapy.When you remove a tumour,the bad cells may still be there somewhere in the body,so chemo is done to kill them.Its not a common cancer amongst children.Leukemia is more common within pediatrics cancer.When you hear the word cancer as a parent,a lot of things play out in your mind.The doctors have told us that if we would have had to pick a certain kind of cancer,it would be WILMS as the prognosis for this cancer is 90-95 % making the survival rate pretty high.Children are very resilient.The word cancer for parents is the scariest thing in the world,but what they need to understand is that 95% of cancer is curable,which is what we dont get to hear as the narrative of the word cancer is so overwhelmingly full of terror.But this sane voice is not built on hope,but on scientific evidence of past prognosis."},

{"body": "In an episode that recalls the book burnings that took place in Hitlers Germany,an obscure right-wing group has prompted the publishers to withdraw from the market and destroy copies of a book on Hindus written by an American author,Wendy Doniger,on the grounds that the work would offend the religious sentiments of the majority community.Without going into the merits or otherwise of the book in question,liberals and all those who believe in the constitutional right to freedom of expression have denounced this enforced ban.The proscription of the book,however,does serve a useful purpose: it underlines,yet again,the unbridgeable gap between what has come to be called Hindutva and the many different,often divergent,schools of thought which over millennia have acquired the name of Hinduism."},
{"body": "As in the present case,the voice of Hindutva claims to speak for all Hindus and for Hinduism in general.Nothing could be further from the truth.The RSS-inspired ideology of so-called cultural nationalism that has been labelled Hindutva can be said to be the antithesis of Hindu thought and belief."},
{"body": "Intolerance  dogmatic refusal to see any point of view but that which is your own  is at the core of Hindutva.If something so expansive and fluid can be said to have a core,the core of Hinduism is the exact opposite to that of Hindutva: not quiescent tolerance,but the rigorous obligation to acknowledge that which might be diametrically opposed to what any one of us may affirm."},
{"body": "The concept of Anekantavada,the imperative to adjudge the others affirmation to be as valid as ones own,held up by Jainism,is the pivot on which the always revolving door of Hinduism is hinged.Anekantavada is the living embodiment of the proposition that the opposite of a great truth is not a great lie but another great truth.Hindutva claims to have the answers to everything.Did Swami Vivekananda and M K Gandhi ever eat beef,as Wendy Doniger has said in her book,among many other objectionable things Certainly not! To even suggest such a thing is utter blasphemy.Exorcise the demon of heresy.Ban the book.Ban all thought contrary to the thinking of Hindutva.Ban all questions,ban all doubt.Hinduism doesnt claim to have the final answer to anything.All that it claims,if anything,is that all answers can always admit of yet another question.What has been called the duty of doubt is the central tenet of both science and the spiritual DNA of Hinduism.Science does not accord any scientific truth the status of immutability,of being changeless and unchallengeable.What is called the scientific method deals not with unquestionable truths  another term for dogma  but with working hypotheses which continue to work only until they are disproven by another hypothesis."},

"},
{"body": "Since last week,good people have been leaving two quotations on the nonfibrous walls of Facebook and Twitter to show their solidarity with books in general and one book in particular.One is American science fiction writer Ray Bradburys opening line from Fahrenheit 451,his 1951 novel about a world where books are banned and burned if found:  It was a pleasure to burn. "},
{"body": "The other quote is from German poet-essayist Heinrich Heines 1821 play Almansor:  That was but a prelude;where they burn books,they will ultimately burn people as well. Heines line here refers to the burning of the Quran by Catholic zealots of the Spanish Inquisition."},
{"body": "Both quotes use the act of book-burning as a metaphor for the banning of books.Books,to be sure,have been burned by custodians of social order since at least 7th century BC when the king of Judah burned a part of the prophet Jeremiahs scroll.Bakhtiyar Khilji didnt bother to arrange bonfires to destroy bad books in 1193.He just set the whole library of Nalanda University on fire.And,most memorably for History Channel enthusiasts,there was the Nazi regime which created a genre of books under the tag of un-German literature and then had fun chucking them in community bonfires."},
{"body": "These acts of libricide are thuggish vandalism.Such activities were,"},
{"body": "and are,acts of punishment  they punish books,their authors,their publishers and their owners from whose homes and libraries these books were confiscated.My kind of book-burning,on the other hand,is a quiet,private affair."},
{"body": "The book,for all its secular sacredness,is so burnable.Anyone who has lit a fireplace has used crumpled newspaper without feeling guilty.This is partly because compared to books,this form of paper is cheap and imbued with a tragic (but understandable) shelf-life.Also,journalists are not quite considered to be writers even when they write books."},
{"body": "But books have been,since at least the printing press was invented,not individual objects with only a few originals lying around like Rembrandts.If a copy of,say,Anthony Bourdains Medium Raw is put to the roast,there will be other copies to procure according to the laws of supply-demand."},

{"body": "In stating that hes single,with no family ties,and thus has no need to be corrupt,BJPs PM candidate Narendra Modis repeated a clich thats echoed meaninglessly down the ages through Indian politics.The view that people become corrupt just because of needling,wheedling kith and kin and hence,not having family ties makes you a better politician doesnt stand scrutiny.In fact,this collapses spectacularly when allegations of corruption pop up against several Indian politicos  from Mayawati to Naveen Patnaik and Jayalalithaa  who fit the single bill."},
{"body": "The idea that people grow corrupt only to feather their familys nest,and have no personal stakes themselves,is laughable.Most politicians are acutely aware of their partys funding needs,a factor that ties in closely with their own ambitions.The ability to deliver to party coffers and thereby strengthen backing for oneself is a powerful impetus for corruption.And it doesnt involve family at all.Unlike the myth that having an ascetic manner and abjuring family ties makes one a better representative,thats a hard fact.Seeing the ascetic/celibate mode as somehow purer comes from a rather dated Gandhian notion of self-denial being good for the soul.To find Modi espousing this view today is ironical  since in doing so,hes effectively endorsing the corruption-free claim his single rival,Rahul Gandhi,can also make."},
{"body": "The fact is,politicians become corrupt if their individual morals are weak and the larger backdrop lacks sufficient mechanisms to check them.Given the weakness of governance in India,even Santa Claus might try diddling the system.It is only discernment between power gained ethically and not  and knowledge that the latter will hurt your reputation and land you in jail  that keeps people corruption-free,regardless of whether theyre single,married or somewhere in between."},
{"body": "When public trust in politics in general and politicians in particular is at a low ebb,BJP prime ministerial aspirant Narendra Modi has reinforced the long-held belief in India that a public official without familial baggage is best suited to effectively battle corruption.In the 13 years that he has been Gujarat chief minister,there have been no allegations of corruption against Modi or complaints that he used his office for personal gain or that any family member took undue advantage to profit by using his name.Being single helps a politician remain committed to the principles of good governance,integrity,openness and honesty."},
{"body": "Modi has made it big without belonging to any dynasty or prominent family,minimising the opportunity to be exposed to corrupt practices.But as many as 27 MPs in the 15Lok Sabha belong to prominent political or business families.Most of them have shown little inclination to take up the fight against corruption,since staying in power is correlated to nepotistic practices which undeniably corrodes the political system and governance.Politicians belonging to one dynasty or other have lax principles about personal integrity and show greater propensity to succumb to pulls and pressures of one family member or another."},
{"body": "Apart from the many allegations of corruption against Congress,a party held together by the aura of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty,Mulayam Singh Yadav and Lalu Prasad too run parties where the taint of corruption is strong.Its not a coincidence that these are family- and dynasty-run parties,perhaps even more so than Congress.That few political families are keen to step away from the power and lucre of office is attested to by the reign of dynasties in Punjab,Haryana,J&K,Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu among other states."},

{"body": "Interim budgets choice of spending cuts will cast a shadow on economic recovery "},
{"body": "Finance minister P Chidambarams second and last budget with UPA-II was incoherent,characterising this governments economic management.For the third consecutive year economic growth will be below the decades average of 7.6% and the blame cannot all be laid at the door of a global slowdown.On the face of it,Chidambaram has outperformed expectations by restricting fiscal deficit to 4.6% of GDP.However,a closer look at the manner in which it was done and some of his proposals to stimulate the economy dont augur well for the future."},
{"body": "A budget influences the economy by the extent and pattern of government spending and the manner in which it is financed.UPA-II inherited some problems of the tail end of its predecessor,UPA-I  a slippage in deficit targets,a global financial crisis and an unsustainable fiscal stimulus.Five years on,the economy is probably more fragile.Yesterdays interim budget shows why.In a year where the economy has grown a tad faster,tax collections have fallen.Yet,the fiscal deficit target has been bettered.The secret is that government spending on infrastructure development has been lower than its plans for the second year in a row even as subsidies overshot."},
{"body": "Fiscal consolidation of the last two years has come at the expense of weakening Indias potential output.Some of this years measures such as squeezing larger dividends out of public sector companies are one-off moves,which is going to make economic management more challenging for the next government."},
{"body": "The highlight of the budget was a reduction in indirect taxes to boost demand in areas as diverse as SUVs and mobile phones.This may be politically convenient but otherwise the second best option.By reducing tax rates in the backdrop of a shortfall in tax collections,UPA-II has given up on a better alternative.A fiscal deficit produces maximum impact if government spending complements the private sector.Infrastructure investment is the prerequisite to remove bottlenecks that limit supply of goods and services."},
{"body": "The interim budget,unfortunately,chose an expedient way of boosting demand.Moreover,given that RBI has increased interest rates thrice in the last five months to hold back aggregate demand as its main inflation fighting strategy,a cut in indirect taxes now runs counter to current monetary policy.An important reason why inflation has remained elevated through UPA-IIs term is that fiscal and monetary policies have rarely been in harmony.The situation continues."},
{"body": "A look at the subsidies bill for 2013-14 shows why Chidambarams fiscal consolidation effort is unimpressive.Major subsidies in revised estimates of 2013-14 were Rs 2.45 trillion,or almost Rs 25,000 crore higher than the original budget estimate.Most of the increase came on account of the Rs 85,480 crore fuel subsidies,which was a little over Rs 20,000 crore above target.Successive governments have emphasised the importance of switching spending from subsidies to public investment.However,the data in interim budget documents shows that there has been no switch in patterns of spending and targets have been met by large cuts in important areas where there is no political pressure group to fight the case."},
{"body": "The poor quality of fiscal consolidation seen recently and some other measures will leave a harmful legacy for the next government.To begin with,it will have to contend with inadequate tax collections.To make matters tougher,spending will have to increase on food subsidy as the legislation will be effective next year;on salaries and pensions on account of another pay commission and one rank one pension for armed services and possibly fertiliser subsidy as natural gas price is set to rise."},
{"body": "UPA-IIs successor is unlikely to have an easy option of forcing a public sector company like Coal India to pay a special dividend to the government.Economic mismanagement of the last five years will inevitably cast a shadow over the pace of economic recovery."},

{"body": "burdened by adverse growth-inflation dynamics,its easy to get disappointed.There was hope in some quarters that the interim budget would boost sentiment and lay the groundwork for kickstarting the investment cycle while staying on a path of fiscal consolidation.Such hopes were always unrealistic."},
{"body": "For starters,any vote on account is constrained in its scale and scope and avoids big-bang direct tax changes and policy reforms.So industry can always quibble that enough wasnt done.Yet others will bemoan the quality of fiscal adjustment.But while each of these may be legitimate concerns,collectively they miss the bigger picture."},
{"body": "Six months ago India was the poster child of emerging market vulnerability.Current account deficit was an unsustainable 5% of GDP,the rupee was falling like a stone,RBI had hiked rates by 300 bps to prop up the rupee and capital market sentiment had plunged.With growth  and therefore tax collections  bound to suffer and subsidies under pressure from 15% currency depreciation,almost nobody imagined a fiscal deficit even close to 5% of GDP,let alone 4.6%.Not a day went by without mention of a sovereign ratings downgrade."},
{"body": "As it turns out,for the first time in 28 years,GDP growth is on course to print below 5% for a second successive year.The fact that,in this adverse macroeconomic environment,and with general elections approaching,the finance minister has been able to meet  and beat  his target for each of the last two years,needs to be commended.On a cyclically-adjusted basis,total consolidation over the last two years is a substantial 1.1% of GDP.This is admirable fiscal restraint in a challenging environment."},
{"body": "More generally,fiscal adjustment has been crucial to restoring macroeconomic stability.Unlike South Africa and Turkey  Indias emerging market peers  Indias current account deficit is expected to print at 2% of GDP,less than half its level of 4.7% of GDP last year.Much of this is because of the curb on gold imports.But some of this is because current accounts evil twin  fiscal deficit  has been consolidated."},
{"body": "Indias twin deficits are now seen as the most visible manifestations of macroeconomic adjustment and there is no more loose talk about a ratings downgrade.Consequently the rupee is among the best performing currencies since the taper began! So lets ascribe credit where its due."},
{"body": "But with emerging markets expected to be under sustained stress as the Fed normalises monetary policy,one cannot sit back on laurels.And while the fiscal consolidation of the last two years is laudable,reaching 3% of GDP by FY17  as per the fiscal roadmap  will not be sustainable unless we see genuine fiscal reform going forward."},
{"body": "In fact,pressures are likely to rise next year itself.FM has pegged next years deficit at 4.1% of GDP  a 0.5% of GDP consolidation over the next year.These numbers are not binding.The full budget in July can alter these estimates.But the math currently laid out illustrates the magnitude of the challenge."},
{"body": "To get to next years deficit,tax revenues  which grew less than 12% this year  will have to grow at a whopping 19%.And this despite excise duty cuts in consumer durables and capital goods! Similarly,disinvestment proceeds have only been able to manage Rs 25,000 crore in each of the last two years.Yet,next year they are budgeted at a whopping Rs 57,000 crore."},
{"body": "Finally,subsidies have been budgeted at almost the same level as this years outturn.But with food subsidies sure to surge under the Right to Food security,one will have to see appreciable rationalisation of LPG,kerosene and urea prices  apart from the ongoing diesel price increases  to stay close to subsidy targets.The bottom line is next years consolidation looks challenging barring a sharp upturn in growth."},
{"body": "All this underscores a more fundamental point  that further consolidation cannot rely on pushing out Plan expenditures,running up arrears on subsidies,and squeezing public sector enterprises.We need genuine fiscal reforms  like long-overdue GST that truly makes India a common market and promotes allocative efficiency,and extending Aadhaar to all subsidies  so that de-duplication benefits of eliminating ghost beneficiaries can accrue.Without these reforms,its hard to envision sustained fiscal consolidation."},
{"body": "But the challenge for the new government  of whatever political hue  is even greater: to boost potential growth.The reason why GDP growth is below 5% but core CPI inflation is above 8% is simple  Indias potential growth has fallen markedly in recent years.And its not hard to see why.Indias corporate investment rate  which reached a high of 17% of GDP in the pre-Lehman year  has collapsed to 9% of GDP."},
{"body": "Government has to mount an all-out war on implementation bottlenecks,bureaucratic risk aversion and regulatory uncertainty.And we need comprehensive and quick resolution of the debt overhang on infrastructure balance sheets,and the associated stress on bank balance sheets.Only then will the investment cycle revive.And only then will potential growth rise again."},
{"body": "The challenge is daunting.But not impossible.Because as the fisc over the last two years has demonstrated: when policymakers truly put the weight of their resolve behind an outcome,they find a way or make one."},

{"body": "Lack of really qualified trainers in business schools is a major concern for all of us.If we want to attract quality faculty,the Government of India has to take benevolent and encouraging measures.One such step would be to ensure that the salaries of teachers and faculties are exempted from tax.Many states have declared free education up to graduation level.If the Government can beat this expenditure why cant the professors and teachers be exempted "},
{"body": "from the liability of Income Tax It should be noted that the people whom they train are national assets.The foreign exchange reserves can also be attributed to some extend coming from those trained by these faculties and deployed globally by our IT and other companies.The B-Schools can never compete until they get trainers as professors.No PhD can be a substitute to the real corporate experience.But,why should the people come to academics leaving their career Periodic engagements and guest lectures cannot solve the problem of - quality.What is it that a BSchool can offer compared to industry on a long term basis The corporate sector provides steady growth,status and good compensation/ remuneration;therefore,the B-Schools have to match this demand at least midway if they want to employ industry trained-faculty."},
{"body": "Here is where the Governmet should step in very effectively.The current system of taxation would cause the faculty to pay out 30 percent of their meagre salary as tax.The educator is also required to pay the education cess.This is a substantial amount as they do pay various central/state taxes.What is left for them to be happy and to lead an inspiring life How many of them can do teaching as a social service and why should they do that Is it not the basic responsibility of the Government to provide quality education And when the incomes of the trusts are exempted from tax why should tax be there for the salaries paid from the funds of the trust "},
{"body": "The other requirement,for the industry trained trainers,to join B-Schools is their appointment should be based on their experience rather than depending on outdated or irrelevant PhDs.Management science should not be treated as pure academics.If only doctors can teach medicine,lawyers can teach law only management professionals from corporate sectors should teach core management subjects in B-Schools.This is what is happening in good B-Schools in developed economies.Quite a lot of corporate leaders are keen to join the academic world provided they are compensated appropriately.But,the conditions prescribed for a Professor or Associate professor disable them from joining B-Schools."},
{"body": "These critical and well trained corporate resources can be attracted if the profession of teaching is given the status of 'Noble Profession' which would mean exemption of taxes on income earned by teachers and faculty "},

{"body": "In an election-year sop targeted at the youth,over 9 lakh students who took education loans before March 2009 will benefit from a Rs 2,600-crore interest rate subsidy proposed by P Chidambaram.The subsidy provided in the form of an interest moratorium is applicable up to December 2013,which means borrowers must resume interest payments from 2014."},

{"body": "Most students who took loans before 2009 came into the job market when the economy was in a slowdown and couldnt get jobs immediately which reduced their ability to repay.The moratorium has been announced because students who took loans before 2009 couldnt get advantage of the subvention scheme, said MV Tanksale,MD & CEO Indian Banks Association.Tanksale said there was no scope of misuse as the benefits were for a clearly-defined scheme.Bankers said the move would benefit lenders.If theres any overdue in interest payments in any loan itd be classified as NPA.Now,all loans will become standard assets as long as they meet interest obligations after January, a banker said."},
