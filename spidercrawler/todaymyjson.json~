[{"body": "Finance minister shows admirable fiscal restraint in an election year "},
{"body": "Its easy to get "},
{"body": "lost in the weeds."},
{"body": "For an economy "},
{"body": "burdened by adverse growth-inflation dynamics,its easy to get disappointed.There was hope in some quarters that the interim budget would boost sentiment and lay the groundwork for kickstarting the investment cycle while staying on a path of fiscal consolidation.Such hopes were always unrealistic."},
{"body": "For starters,any vote on account is constrained in its scale and scope and avoids big-bang direct tax changes and policy reforms.So industry can always quibble that enough wasnt done.Yet others will bemoan the quality of fiscal adjustment.But while each of these may be legitimate concerns,collectively they miss the bigger picture."},
{"body": "Six months ago India was the poster child of emerging market vulnerability.Current account deficit was an unsustainable 5% of GDP,the rupee was falling like a stone,RBI had hiked rates by 300 bps to prop up the rupee and capital market sentiment had plunged.With growth  and therefore tax collections  bound to suffer and subsidies under pressure from 15% currency depreciation,almost nobody imagined a fiscal deficit even close to 5% of GDP,let alone 4.6%.Not a day went by without mention of a sovereign ratings downgrade."},
{"body": "As it turns out,for the first time in 28 years,GDP growth is on course to print below 5% for a second successive year.The fact that,in this adverse macroeconomic environment,and with general elections approaching,the finance minister has been able to meet  and beat  his target for each of the last two years,needs to be commended.On a cyclically-adjusted basis,total consolidation over the last two years is a substantial 1.1% of GDP.This is admirable fiscal restraint in a challenging environment."},
{"body": "More generally,fiscal adjustment has been crucial to restoring macroeconomic stability.Unlike South Africa and Turkey  Indias emerging market peers  Indias current account deficit is expected to print at 2% of GDP,less than half its level of 4.7% of GDP last year.Much of this is because of the curb on gold imports.But some of this is because current accounts evil twin  fiscal deficit  has been consolidated."},
{"body": "Indias twin deficits are now seen as the most visible manifestations of macroeconomic adjustment and there is no more loose talk about a ratings downgrade.Consequently the rupee is among the best performing currencies since the taper began! So lets ascribe credit where its due."},
{"body": "But with emerging markets expected to be under sustained stress as the Fed normalises monetary policy,one cannot sit back on laurels.And while the fiscal consolidation of the last two years is laudable,reaching 3% of GDP by FY17  as per the fiscal roadmap  will not be sustainable unless we see genuine fiscal reform going forward."},
{"body": "In fact,pressures are likely to rise next year itself.FM has pegged next years deficit at 4.1% of GDP  a 0.5% of GDP consolidation over the next year.These numbers are not binding.The full budget in July can alter these estimates.But the math currently laid out illustrates the magnitude of the challenge."},
{"body": "To get to next years deficit,tax revenues  which grew less than 12% this year  will have to grow at a whopping 19%.And this despite excise duty cuts in consumer durables and capital goods! Similarly,disinvestment proceeds have only been able to manage Rs 25,000 crore in each of the last two years.Yet,next year they are budgeted at a whopping Rs 57,000 crore."},
{"body": "Finally,subsidies have been budgeted at almost the same level as this years outturn.But with food subsidies sure to surge under the Right to Food security,one will have to see appreciable rationalisation of LPG,kerosene and urea prices  apart from the ongoing diesel price increases  to stay close to subsidy targets.The bottom line is next years consolidation looks challenging barring a sharp upturn in growth."},
{"body": "All this underscores a more fundamental point  that further consolidation cannot rely on pushing out Plan expenditures,running up arrears on subsidies,and squeezing public sector enterprises.We need genuine fiscal reforms  like long-overdue GST that truly makes India a common market and promotes allocative efficiency,and extending Aadhaar to all subsidies  so that de-duplication benefits of eliminating ghost beneficiaries can accrue.Without these reforms,its hard to envision sustained fiscal consolidation."},
{"body": "But the challenge for the new government  of whatever political hue  is even greater: to boost potential growth.The reason why GDP growth is below 5% but core CPI inflation is above 8% is simple  Indias potential growth has fallen markedly in recent years.And its not hard to see why.Indias corporate investment rate  which reached a high of 17% of GDP in the pre-Lehman year  has collapsed to 9% of GDP."},
{"body": "Government has to mount an all-out war on implementation bottlenecks,bureaucratic risk aversion and regulatory uncertainty.And we need comprehensive and quick resolution of the debt overhang on infrastructure balance sheets,and the associated stress on bank balance sheets.Only then will the investment cycle revive.And only then will potential growth rise again."},
{"body": "The challenge is daunting.But not impossible.Because as the fisc over the last two years has demonstrated: when policymakers truly put the weight of their resolve behind an outcome,they find a way or make one."},

{"body": "I guess I was trying to make sure you get through to the day knowing you have earned the right to get through the day after the pressure we have had to absorb.I am pretty tired at the moment,body is a little bit sore,but when you are scoring runs,your body does not hurt so much, he said."},
{"body": "Thats probably how a marathoner feels after winning.Speaking about their plans,he said: It has been a great day.We set our game plans and our strategies and you dream the dreams and you don't always live them.Today,BJ and myself were able to put ourselves in a very good position.We are pleased.We have decisions to make overnight. "},
{"body": "The captain realises that they have to strike a balance between two things: number of runs to offer to be safe and amount of time to get India all out.Obviously we are 1-0 up in the series.We have worked really hard to get back into this contest so that is one decision we have to look at,and whether we try and push on for a Test win or we look to consolidate the lead. "},
{"body": "McCullum was full of praise for Watling's contribution too.I am really pleased with BJ.We know how much of a scrapper he is.He has got that real resilient streak about him.Special kind of pluck to stand up and do what he did in this Test and bat as long as he did for us to able to create that partnership. "},
{"body": "His partner in crime,Watling said: It was a grind.Just took each ball at a time,each over at a time,each hour at a time.They came at us hard and we sort of weathered the storm and then got a few runs away and just kept trying to take them as deep as we could.To lose one wicket is a pretty pleasing effort. "},
{"body": "He conceded that it was all about one wicket.The first hour was crucial.If we managed to not lose a wicket there,we felt we could kick on and try and keep going.Each session that started was just about starting again and keeping the partnership going and getting as many runs and taking as much time out of the game as possible.

{"body": "Skippers Marathon 281* & 352-Run Stand With Watling (124) Puts Hosts In Command "},
{"body": "Wellington: Just after his team watched the Auckland Test slip out of its fingers,MS Dhoni,rather patronizingly,declared: We are playing well but not converting our opportunities. He wouldn't know at that point that he was making a selffulfilling prophecy."},
{"body": "At exactly the halfway stage of the second Test,India had created another golden opportunity: after taking a well-meaning 246-run lead in the first innings,they had brought New Zealand to their knees at 94 for five;and then,in a fit of complacency,they dropped Brendon McCullum,not once but twice."},
{"body": "By the evening itself,they may have sensed that they had blown away the mother of all opportunities;yet,even as McCullum and BJ Watling were constructing an escape,they were behaving as if it was just a matter of time: one wicket and we will seal the victory.The wicket came eventually,inevitably.About 550 minutes.123 overs.And 352 record-breaking runs later."},
{"body": "By then,the chance had evaporated.As if that was not enough,they allowed debutant Jimmy Neesham to rub another 125 runs into their wounds;by close of play,on Day 4,New Zealand had amassed 571 for six,an improbable 325-run lead,and were even contemplating victory."},
{"body": "As the pitch has dried out to become a pasture,they would be wary of Indias batting might and desperation;they will probably wait for McCullum to reach his maiden triple hundred,bat for maybe an hour and give themselves a shot at bowling them out.Anything is possible."},
{"body": "The New Zealand skipper stood like a mountain between them and the glimmer of a rare away victory;he batted like a monk for over oneand-half days (281: 525b,28x4,4x6); he was as if in a deep trance,never ruffled by the hustle-bustle around him or the prospect of an unwitting error,and then,the inescapable collapse."},
{"body": "He ignored the messages his body was flashing all through his long vigil : a pain in the shoulder,another in the back,and the fear in his knees;his mind didn't waver even once as he dealt with every ball purely on its merit,as if it was a crime to flirt with risk.There was almost a fanaticism in his approach."},
{"body": "McCullum ran every run spiritedly,and every stroke was loaded with the same power and intent;by the end of the day,he had broken virtually every record within his reach: the world record sixth-wicket partnership,his longest stint in the middle,the first Kiwi to score back-to-back doubles and the third one to score three."},
{"body": "As the evening faded,the enormity of his effort slowly dawned: every spectator applauded each time he even touched the ball,let alone clouted a boundary.In the entire magnum opus,one aspect was worthy of more marvel though: the way he tackled every landmark.If he danced down the track to jump from 94 to 100 with a six on Sunday,he reached 150 and 200 with boundaries too.It was just an indication of what he could have done if he had chosen not to bat like a monk."},
{"body": "McCullum was ably and manfully supported by Watling in his mission : batting almost without a flaw,and perhaps with even more zeal,the wicketkeeper helped in blunting the Indian attack completely.He kept 367 precious deliveries in abeyance,and helped himself to 13 boundaries only when it was unavoidable."},
{"body": "Resuming literally at 6 for five in the morning,they (McCullum 114 and Watling 52) needed to do something monumental to save the Test;they did slightly better,giving themselves an outside chance to win."},
{"body": "India have only themselves to blame.You dont win Tests by waiting for something to happen;you make them happen.Dhoni attacked in the first half hour but thereafter switched to defensive tactics in the belief that the rash stroke was on the anvil.He shuffled his bowlers through the day,but in a mechanical way;the field setting was also predictable,allowing breathing space to the batsmen."},
{"body": "Jadeja bowled 49 overs without any impact;the pacers shared the burden and barely got a sniff of a reward on a merciless track.Much later,Dhoni summoned Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli too,and himself bowled one,but all to no avail."},

{"body": "At present,Pune has only one PSK in Mundhwa that caters to more than 1,000 passport applicants on a daily basis,including those coming from Ahmednagar,Kolhapur,Sangli,Satara and Solapur (city and rural).Due to the heavy load,those applying in the normal category have to wait for 35 days on an average for a scheduled appointment."},

{"body": "His suggestion got a thumbs up also from Vijay Kumbhar,co-convener of Pune Passport Grievances Forum that held an agitation in 2013 for improving the facilities and services offered by the PSK in Mundhwa.We definitely need not one,but two more PSKs in the city.The total area of Pune has increased in the last couple of years and commuting to the PSK,which is located in one corner of the city,is a harrowing experience.It would be best to have a similar facility in the west-end of the city to cater to areas like Katraj,Bavdhan and Hinjewadi, he said."},
{"body": "According to Kumbhar,the heavy load of Tatkal applications are the result of poor services in the normal category.Aspirants have no option but to apply under the Tatkal category as there is no guarantee of time-bound delivery by the routine procedure.Pune is home to the IT and auto-hubs in which there can be sudden demands for international travel,so the high numbers are not surprising, he said,questioning the objection of the RPO considering fees for Tatkal is almost double that of normal."},

{"body": "We are confident as we have made several innovations to improve last years design, said Prem Mishra,a final-year mechanical engineering student who is the captain of the team."},
{"body": "This year,the MK-8  has replaced a conventional stickshift gear box with a Continuous Variable Transmission (CVT),which Mishra hopes will allow the car to accelerate much faster."},
{"body": "Think of it as the difference between riding a motorcycle and a non-geared bike.You dont have to shift the gears,the vehicle changes gears automatically.This way,we cut down on the time taken by the driver to shift between gears, said team member Abhijeet Nassery."},

{"body": "Last year,we were the winners of the acceleration test  which tests how long the vehicle takes to cover a 150-ft distance from zero speed to full throttle.We had clocked 6.65 seconds while the team that came second did it in 6.67 seconds, he said."},
{"body": "With the CVT,the car does it much faster,but the team is tight-lipped about the specifics.Moreover,the results of the acceleration test decide the pole position in the endurance race  a four-hour race that tests the car through rough terrain,Mishra said."},

{"body": "We have managed to drop the weight by building customised parts instead of using standard ones.Instead of steel,we have built parts from spacegrade aluminium,which is much lighter, said Mishra.About 70% of the car has been custom-built,he added."},

{"body": "Fi n a n c e m i n i s t e r P Chidambaram has been applauded by many for showing fiscal rectitude in an election year,but a closer look at the budget numbers suggests that both in the current year,2013-14,and in the coming year,the numbers look better than the reality."},
{"body": "In the current year,the finance ministers budget speech pointed out,the fi scal deficit is likely to be 4.6% of GDP,even lower than the budget estimate of 4.8%.But this has been achieved not by cutting non-productive spending and boosting earnings.On the contrary,the target has been bettered despite nonplan expenditure  most of which is things like interest payments,subsidies,salaries and pensions  being higher than budgeted and tax revenues being lower than expected."},
{"body": "How was this achieved First,by keeping plan expenditure  which you could see as investing in the future  about Rs 8,000 crore below the budgeted amount and raising non-tax revenues to roughly Rs 21,000 crore more than what the budget for the year had projected.Most of this extra non-tax revenue is by way of dividends and profits from the public sector  in short,transferring money from one pocket of the state to another."},
{"body": "As for 2014-15,some of the expenditure fi gures seem extremely optimistic and the receipts fi gures include a huge jump in infl ows from disinvestment in PSUs.For instance,the subsidy bill on petroleum products is projected to come down from Rs 85,480 crore in the revised estimates for the current year to Rs 63,427 crore next year."},
{"body": "Similarly,the fertiliser subsidy bill is assumed to remain static at around Rs 68,000 crore despite the fact that the new gas pricing formula,which roughly doubles the price of natural gas,is bound to add significantly to input costs for the sector."},

{"body": "A senior PMPML official,who did not wish to be named,said the transport company is facing a major financial crisis.It is not something new that nearly 400 to 450 buses are off the roads.This has been a regular feature for over six months now, the official said."},
{"body": "The situation,the official said,would improve only if the two municipal corporations lend some financial help to PMPML.We are awaiting the state government resolution on the two municipal corporations to set aside at least 2 to 5 % of the budget for PMPML.The transport company can improve only if it gets some financial help, the official said.PMPML has not received any financial help in the recent past from the two corporations,the official added."},
{"body": "Bus depot managers TOI spoke to rued that only breakdown maintenance of buses was being done.PMPML needs to do preventive maintenance so that there is no mechanical failure or breakdowns.Instead,what we are doing is breakdown maintenance, a manager said.Many bus depots lack the technical manpower and basic infrastructure that is required for maintenance of buses."},

{"body": "A Trust can hold all types of assets that can be held by an individual,that is from shares,real estate,mutual funds,demat accounts,fixed deposits,bank accounts,bank lockers to even art and antiques.It is also allowed to sell or rent Trust property and pass on the income from the same to the beneficiaries."},

{"body": "Like equity funds,investors must look at factors beyond performance while selecting debt funds.There are a few unique aspects that investors must check out before short-listing debt funds for making an investment."},
{"body": "Since debt funds are largely categorized on the basis of time periods,investors should select the fund which matches their investment horizon.For instance,for an investment horizon of less than a year,investors can select an ultra-short term or a liquid fund,depending on its aptness in their portfolios.Likewise,for an investment horizon of between one and three years,short-term funds would be more appropriate.However,the investor should bear in mind that higher the maturity of debt funds,more prone they will be to interest rate risks."},
{"body": "This is one of the most neglected but a critical aspect of debt funds.For a long time,debt funds have been perceived to carry very low or no risk.Nothing could be further from the truth.Debt funds carry certain inherent risks such as interest rate,credit and liquidity risks.Before investing in debt funds,investors must bear in mind that these risks can have an adverse impact on a funds return."},
{"body": "This is one of the most prominent risks to which debt funds are exposed to.It refers to a change in the price of a bond due to a change in the prevailing interest rate.Higher the duration of the bond,more its price will tend to fluctuate with the change in the interest rate.Hence,in a rising interest rate scenario,investors must consider selecting funds with lower maturity and visa-versa."},
{"body": "The quality of the portfolio or its credit worthiness is another important parameter for selecting debt funds.Each debt instrument in a fund is assigned a credit rating.Higher the credit rating of the funds underlying instruments,less exposed the fund would be to credit defaults.Credit risk is applicable to corporate bond funds and not to government bond funds since the latter have a government backing."},
{"body": "Liquidity is the ease with which a fund manager can sell a particular security in the market.A fund faces liquidity risk if the fund manager is not able to do so due to lack of demand for the security.Liquidity risk is high in funds having a low credit quality portfolio."},
{"body": "Given that returns from debt funds are typically lower,high expenses could make a huge dent on the returns.Therefore,before selecting a debt fund,investors must ensure that the fund has a pragmatic expense structure.Further,various debt funds levy an exit load if investments are redeemed before a specified period.The idea is to deter short-term flows into the fund in order to enable better management of the investments.Hence,an investor should look into exit loads carefully before investing because,just in case of an early withdrawal,these costs could severely impact returns."},
{"body": "The fund size is an important aspect to look at in debt funds because they typically see huge amounts of assets moving in and out of them on a daily basis.A sufficiently funded debt fund would enable the manager to meet re d e m p t i o n p re s s u re s without resorting to stresssell and keep the investor interest intact.This would also help the fund to stay afloat during adverse market conditions when redemption pressure is high."},
{"body": "Besides these,investors should also look at the funds performance (both returns as well as risk-adjusted returns) over a long period.This will help them understand how effectively the manager has been able to manoeuvre the fund through market cycles."},
{"body": "Stocks of good companies are always a buy."},
{"body": "This is not entirely true.Often it has been seen that a very good company has failed to deliver on profits and growth,and hence its share price has not appreciated as much as its competitors.Although the stocks of good companies usually enjoy some premium over their peers,this premium alone may not be enough to outperform them.So,while the stock of a good company may be a good one to look at and analyze,investors at the time of investing should also look for,among other factors,future growth potential of the companies."},
{"body": "Non-performing assets (NPAs) are those loans that have turned bad,meaning the borrowers of those loans are either willingly or for some other reason neither paying interest nor paying back the principal amount.Higher the NPA level (mostly expressed as a percentage of total loans),worse off is the lender.NPAs usually show a rising trend in bad economic conditions.Globally,higher NPAs (also called non-performing loans and bad loans) have often been one of the major factors for the bankruptcy of a financial institution or the closure of a bank."},

{"body": "Interest rate going up is behind us and I dont see any logic for interest rates to go up in future.The good news around the corner is that food prices,which were the cause of high inflation numbers,is coming down.If food inflation eases,RBI has a better rationale to hold or bring down interest rates, said Deepak Parekh,chairman,HDFC.He added that downward revisions would be in small measures and there was no scope for large reductions."},
{"body": "Among bankers there has been some uncertainty over which way rates would move given that RBI has indicated that it is keen to make inflation-targeting its major objective and that it is likely to target consumer prices in future.Falling inflation should bring down interest rates,but with RBI targeting consumer prices it is difficult to say as food prices tend to go up during summer, Arundhati Bhattacharya,chairman,State Bank of India,had said on Friday."},
{"body": "In his speech,the finance minister,however,goaded RBI not to focus exclusively on inflation and to strike a balance between growth and controlling prices.What has cheered the bond markets is the modest government borrowing programme announced by the finance minister.Sonal Varma,an economist with Nomura,said,In FY15,the government has set a fiscal deficit target of 4.1% of GDP,which is marginally better than the expected 4.2%."},
{"body": "Net market borrowing of Rs 4.57 lakh crore is expected to finance 87% of the fiscal deficit,while gross market borrowings are likely at Rs 5.97 lakh crore in FY15,better than market expectations which were in the range of Rs 6.1-6.4 lakh crore. "},

{"body": "The concept of Anekantavada,the imperative to adjudge the others affirmation to be as valid as ones own,held up by Jainism,is the pivot on which the always revolving door of Hinduism is hinged.Anekantavada is the living embodiment of the proposition that the opposite of a great truth is not a great lie but another great truth.Hindutva claims to have the answers to everything.Did Swami Vivekananda and M K Gandhi ever eat beef,as Wendy Doniger has said in her book,among many other objectionable things Certainly not! To even suggest such a thing is utter blasphemy.Exorcise the demon of heresy.Ban the book.Ban all thought contrary to the thinking of Hindutva.Ban all questions,ban all doubt.Hinduism doesnt claim to have the final answer to anything.All that it claims,if anything,is that all answers can always admit of yet another question.What has been called the duty of doubt is the central tenet of both science and the spiritual DNA of Hinduism.Science does not accord any scientific truth the status of immutability,of being changeless and unchallengeable.What is called the scientific method deals not with unquestionable truths  another term for dogma  but with working hypotheses which continue to work only until they are disproven by another hypothesis."},

{"body": "Now,this wont go down well with my liberal friends or my fundamentalist buddies,but the truth of the matter is that i like burning books."},
{"body": "Obviously im not going to tell you what books i have consigned to the flames over the years.But to watch a printed page turn orangey-dark,then suddenly catch fire usually from the middle,and then let itself be eaten by fire while it curls,curls,curls taking the bending black letters and lines with them,is a quiet act of beauty.(Burning photographs comes a close second,but at my age it is a bit operatic.) "},
{"body": "Since last week,good people have been leaving two quotations on the nonfibrous walls of Facebook and Twitter to show their solidarity with books in general and one book in particular.One is American science fiction writer Ray Bradburys opening line from Fahrenheit 451,his 1951 novel about a world where books are banned and burned if found:  It was a pleasure to burn. "},
{"body": "The other quote is from German poet-essayist Heinrich Heines 1821 play Almansor:  That was but a prelude;where they burn books,they will ultimately burn people as well. Heines line here refers to the burning of the Quran by Catholic zealots of the Spanish Inquisition."},
{"body": "Both quotes use the act of book-burning as a metaphor for the banning of books.Books,to be sure,have been burned by custodians of social order since at least 7th century BC when the king of Judah burned a part of the prophet Jeremiahs scroll.Bakhtiyar Khilji didnt bother to arrange bonfires to destroy bad books in 1193.He just set the whole library of Nalanda University on fire.And,most memorably for History Channel enthusiasts,there was the Nazi regime which created a genre of books under the tag of un-German literature and then had fun chucking them in community bonfires."},
{"body": "These acts of libricide are thuggish vandalism.Such activities were,"},
{"body": "and are,acts of punishment  they punish books,their authors,their publishers and their owners from whose homes and libraries these books were confiscated.My kind of book-burning,on the other hand,is a quiet,private affair."},
{"body": "The book,for all its secular sacredness,is so burnable.Anyone who has lit a fireplace has used crumpled newspaper without feeling guilty.This is partly because compared to books,this form of paper is cheap and imbued with a tragic (but understandable) shelf-life.Also,journalists are not quite considered to be writers even when they write books."},
{"body": "But books have been,since at least the printing press was invented,not individual objects with only a few originals lying around like Rembrandts.If a copy of,say,Anthony Bourdains Medium Raw is put to the roast,there will be other copies to procure according to the laws of supply-demand."},
{"body": "Most of the books ive burned have been ones i have found worthless.But i experienced a special pleasure in tearing out pages of books i like,even adore,to see how the pages first burn,then climb into air pushed up by warm convection currents,and then descend as scattered bits when the heat goes out.These remnants of pages,now incredibly fragile,still bear printed words.The charcoaled tatters of the ex-page are literally as black as soot while the words have turned a phantom grey.This is the books dismembered ghost."},
{"body": "Ive never stolen books to burn.I have only burned books that were bought.In fact,my kind of book-burning,unlike burning money that takes a commodity out of circulation,actually feeds a demand.Which makes the burning of books so much more civilised than banning or forcing them out of circulation."},

{"body": "In stating that hes single,with no family ties,and thus has no need to be corrupt,BJPs PM candidate Narendra Modis repeated a clich thats echoed meaninglessly down the ages through Indian politics.The view that people become corrupt just because of needling,wheedling kith and kin and hence,not having family ties makes you a better politician doesnt stand scrutiny.In fact,this collapses spectacularly when allegations of corruption pop up against several Indian politicos  from Mayawati to Naveen Patnaik and Jayalalithaa  who fit the single bill."},
{"body": "The idea that people grow corrupt only to feather their familys nest,and have no personal stakes themselves,is laughable.Most politicians are acutely aware of their partys funding needs,a factor that ties in closely with their own ambitions.The ability to deliver to party coffers and thereby strengthen backing for oneself is a powerful impetus for corruption.And it doesnt involve family at all.Unlike the myth that having an ascetic manner and abjuring family ties makes one a better representative,thats a hard fact.Seeing the ascetic/celibate mode as somehow purer comes from a rather dated Gandhian notion of self-denial being good for the soul.To find Modi espousing this view today is ironical  since in doing so,hes effectively endorsing the corruption-free claim his single rival,Rahul Gandhi,can also make."},
{"body": "The fact is,politicians become corrupt if their individual morals are weak and the larger backdrop lacks sufficient mechanisms to check them.Given the weakness of governance in India,even Santa Claus might try diddling the system.It is only discernment between power gained ethically and not  and knowledge that the latter will hurt your reputation and land you in jail  that keeps people corruption-free,regardless of whether theyre single,married or somewhere in between."},
{"body": "When public trust in politics in general and politicians in particular is at a low ebb,BJP prime ministerial aspirant Narendra Modi has reinforced the long-held belief in India that a public official without familial baggage is best suited to effectively battle corruption.In the 13 years that he has been Gujarat chief minister,there have been no allegations of corruption against Modi or complaints that he used his office for personal gain or that any family member took undue advantage to profit by using his name.Being single helps a politician remain committed to the principles of good governance,integrity,openness and honesty."},
{"body": "Modi has made it big without belonging to any dynasty or prominent family,minimising the opportunity to be exposed to corrupt practices.But as many as 27 MPs in the 15Lok Sabha belong to prominent political or business families.Most of them have shown little inclination to take up the fight against corruption,since staying in power is correlated to nepotistic practices which undeniably corrodes the political system and governance.Politicians belonging to one dynasty or other have lax principles about personal integrity and show greater propensity to succumb to pulls and pressures of one family member or another."},
{"body": "Apart from the many allegations of corruption against Congress,a party held together by the aura of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty,Mulayam Singh Yadav and Lalu Prasad too run parties where the taint of corruption is strong.Its not a coincidence that these are family- and dynasty-run parties,perhaps even more so than Congress.That few political families are keen to step away from the power and lucre of office is attested to by the reign of dynasties in Punjab,Haryana,J&K,Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu among other states."},

{"body": "Interim budgets choice of spending cuts will cast a shadow on economic recovery "},
{"body": "Finance minister P Chidambarams second and last budget with UPA-II was incoherent,characterising this governments economic management.For the third consecutive year economic growth will be below the decades average of 7.6% and the blame cannot all be laid at the door of a global slowdown.On the face of it,Chidambaram has outperformed expectations by restricting fiscal deficit to 4.6% of GDP.However,a closer look at the manner in which it was done and some of his proposals to stimulate the economy dont augur well for the future."},
{"body": "A budget influences the economy by the extent and pattern of government spending and the manner in which it is financed.UPA-II inherited some problems of the tail end of its predecessor,UPA-I  a slippage in deficit targets,a global financial crisis and an unsustainable fiscal stimulus.Five years on,the economy is probably more fragile.Yesterdays interim budget shows why.In a year where the economy has grown a tad faster,tax collections have fallen.Yet,the fiscal deficit target has been bettered.The secret is that government spending on infrastructure development has been lower than its plans for the second year in a row even as subsidies overshot."},
{"body": "Fiscal consolidation of the last two years has come at the expense of weakening Indias potential output.Some of this years measures such as squeezing larger dividends out of public sector companies are one-off moves,which is going to make economic management more challenging for the next government."},
{"body": "The highlight of the budget was a reduction in indirect taxes to boost demand in areas as diverse as SUVs and mobile phones.This may be politically convenient but otherwise the second best option.By reducing tax rates in the backdrop of a shortfall in tax collections,UPA-II has given up on a better alternative.A fiscal deficit produces maximum impact if government spending complements the private sector.Infrastructure investment is the prerequisite to remove bottlenecks that limit supply of goods and services."},
{"body": "The interim budget,unfortunately,chose an expedient way of boosting demand.Moreover,given that RBI has increased interest rates thrice in the last five months to hold back aggregate demand as its main inflation fighting strategy,a cut in indirect taxes now runs counter to current monetary policy.An important reason why inflation has remained elevated through UPA-IIs term is that fiscal and monetary policies have rarely been in harmony.The situation continues."},
{"body": "A look at the subsidies bill for 2013-14 shows why Chidambarams fiscal consolidation effort is unimpressive.Major subsidies in revised estimates of 2013-14 were Rs 2.45 trillion,or almost Rs 25,000 crore higher than the original budget estimate.Most of the increase came on account of the Rs 85,480 crore fuel subsidies,which was a little over Rs 20,000 crore above target.Successive governments have emphasised the importance of switching spending from subsidies to public investment.However,the data in interim budget documents shows that there has been no switch in patterns of spending and targets have been met by large cuts in important areas where there is no political pressure group to fight the case."},
{"body": "The poor quality of fiscal consolidation seen recently and some other measures will leave a harmful legacy for the next government.To begin with,it will have to contend with inadequate tax collections.To make matters tougher,spending will have to increase on food subsidy as the legislation will be effective next year;on salaries and pensions on account of another pay commission and one rank one pension for armed services and possibly fertiliser subsidy as natural gas price is set to rise."},
{"body": "UPA-IIs successor is unlikely to have an easy option of forcing a public sector company like Coal India to pay a special dividend to the government.Economic mismanagement of the last five years will inevitably cast a shadow over the pace of economic recovery."},
{"body": "Indias most ambitious tax reforms,goods and services tax,has been tripped up by the political battle between Congress and BJP and anxiety of states on losing revenue share.However,the important direct tax reform has also been held up inexplicably.In this instance,the problem seems to be within Congress.Pranab Mukherjee began to move the parliamentary approval process for a direct tax code in 2009.Now,in the governments last budget,Chidambaram plans to invite public comments again on what is presumably a reworked tax code.Who says there isnt any policy paralysis "},

{"body": "He had a malignant tumour called the WILMS tumour which was detected in its second stage.There is a medical protocol for this as he needs to be there for 15 weeks for taking chemotherapy.When you remove a tumour,the bad cells may still be there somewhere in the body,so chemo is done to kill them.Its not a common cancer amongst children.Leukemia is more common within pediatrics cancer.When you hear the word cancer as a parent,a lot of things play out in your mind.The doctors have told us that if we would have had to pick a certain kind of cancer,it would be WILMS as the prognosis for this cancer is 90-95 % making the survival rate pretty high.Children are very resilient.The word cancer for parents is the scariest thing in the world,but what they need to understand is that 95% of cancer is curable,which is what we dont get to hear as the narrative of the word cancer is so overwhelmingly full of terror.But this sane voice is not built on hope,but on scientific evidence of past prognosis."},

{"body": "In a last-ditch gambit to woo the defence community of 14 lakh serving and over 25 lakh retired military personnel,the government has yanked the long-demanded,much-promised but never-implemented one-rank,one-pension (OROP) rabbit out of its hat in the run-up to general elections."},
{"body": "Finance minister P Chidambaram said the OROP decision will be implemented prospectively for armed forces from 2014-15,with the government transferring Rs 500 crore to the defence pension account in the current fiscal to close the gap for all retirees (pre-2006 and post-2006 ) in all ranks."},
{"body": "This comes just after Congress vicepresident Rahul Gandhi told a group of exservicemen last week that he fully backed their OROP demand,in what now seems to be a scripted interaction.The defence community,after all,swells into a sizeable and vocal vote bank of close to 20 million people if family members are also taken into account."},
{"body": "OROP basically implies payment of uniform pension to personnel retiring in the same rank with the same length of service irrespective of their date of retirement.Consequently,any further hike in pension rates is automatically passed on to past pensioners."},
{"body": "Irate ex-servicemen have been returning their medals and holding rallies over the past five years,which included one with BJP prime ministerial nominee Narendra Modi and former Army chief General V K Singh at Rewari last September,to protest against the non-implementation of OROP."},
{"body": "On Monday,there was again scepticism about whether it was full OROP or just the eyewash of modified parity yet again.The UPA was in power for the past 10 years but this comes only now.Moreover,Rs 500 crore seems paltry.Earlier,the MoD and the controller general of defence accounts had calculated Rs 1,730 crore for 2014-15.Another offi cial figure was Rs 3,000 crore per year for OROP, said a senior military offi cer."},
{"body": "But MoD contended that the contours of OROP and its implementation will be worked out in the coming weeks.The Rs 500 crore is just a provisional figure to show the governments intent, said an offi cial.Chidambaram,too,said MoD had asked for Rs 500 crore but if more was required,it would be fully provided."},
{"body": "The government,however,was mum on the legal and administrative reasons used in the past to junk the OROP proposal.Civilian pensioners,for instance,would demand the same with a heavy financial implication of Rs 8,000-9,000 crore per annum,it had held."},
{"body": "There will be no spurt in military modernization.It will continue to meander in its usual slow manner,with the defence outlay being marginally hiked to Rs 224,000 crore in the 2014-15 interim budget.The 10% hike over the previous outlay of Rs 203,672 crore basically just caters for inflation.In dollar terms,there has actually been a dip from $37.86 billion to $36.13 billion due to depreciation of the rupee."},
{"body": "The worry among military experts is that Indias budgeted defence expenditure is merely 1.74% of the projected GDP for 2014-15,much less than the 3% being demanded for years to ensure modernization and requisite deterrence against both China and Pakistan.In fact,its even less than the 1.79% and 1.9% figures,respectively,of the last two fiscals."},

{"body": "The major project is the $20 billion medium multi-role combat aircraft deal for 126 fighters,with final commercial negotiations under way for French Rafale jets.This alone will see an outgo of over Rs 10,000 crore as the first instalment after the contract is inked.Some other important deals close to finalization include the acquisition of 22 Apache attack helicopters (around $1.4 billion),15 Chinook heavy-lift helicopters (around $1 billion),and 145 M-777 ultra-light howitzers ($885 million),all from the US."},

{"body": "Let us look at the role of the Government on this critical issue.After 50 years,on December 1,2013,the present Union Minister for HRD,M M Pallam Raju has said that a new Act is being formulated to ensure that the Regulators of education in India function in a 'coordinated'manner;and that,the Union HRD Minister himself will preside over the meetings of the Regulators once in a quarter or so to resolve 'conflicts',if any,amongst the Regulators.This means,even now coordination is lacking at the highest level of Regulators of the country,Government and stakeholders of education."},
{"body": "All the Regulations are supposed to be placed on the table of Parliament means,thorough scrutiny by law makers is called for.But do our law makers have time to sincerely examine,seriously debate,thoughtfully discuss and genuinely consult the stake holders on these critical issues before arriving at a decision "},
{"body": "The other critical issue is related to faculties.Even heavily supported Central Universities/Institutions are facing acute shortage of faculty.Despite all the rules and regulations,getting the best faculty is a big problem and whatever is happening everywhere is a compromise.That is why one estimate says that only 5 percent of college graduates in India are employable.So,on the one hand it is a problem of PhDs;on the other hand there is the problem of quality.What is more,the need and dynamics of industry is such that these faculty can merely teach the theory but not the practical aspects of industry.Therefore,despite em ploying the 'numbers' the quality conscious institutions are to incur the additional cost of inviting those veterans from vast industrial experience.Overall,teaching is not in the list of 'priority' compared to oth er professions."},
{"body": "That situation can never change until some revolutionary steps are initiated by the Govternmet of India.There are many reasons for this but the prime reason is lack of resources as well as conditions laid down by Regulators for em ployment of teaching staff.Can we expect an MBA to teach at par with those who actually have the experience of working in the industry for at least a decade The Governmet needs to take more positive steps to address the burning issue of quantity as well as quality."},
{"body": "Lack of really qualified trainers in business schools is a major concern for all of us.If we want to attract quality faculty,the Government of India has to take benevolent and encouraging measures.One such step would be to ensure that the salaries of teachers and faculties are exempted from tax.Many states have declared free education up to graduation level.If the Government can beat this expenditure why cant the professors and teachers be exempted "},
